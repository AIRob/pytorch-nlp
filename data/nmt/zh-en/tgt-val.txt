The President (interpretation from Russian): The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
 Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council on Somalia, document S/1994/977.
 "The Security Council takes note of the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council on Somalia (S/1994/977) and briefings by the Secretariat.
 "The Council expresses grave concern regarding the deteriorating security situation in Somalia and deplores attacks and harassment directed against UNISOM II and other international personnel serving in Somalia.
 "The Council considers that a durable political settlement remains an indispensable prerequisite for restoring peace and security, re-establishing central governmental structures and services and commencing the process of rehabilitation and reconstruction of the economic and social fabric in Somalia.
 In this regard, it attaches great importance to an accelerated inter-clan reconciliation, in particular, among the Hawiye sub-clans, with the involvement of all concerned.
 "The Council stresses that the nature and the duration of the international support and resources the international community is committing to Somalia, including the continuing presence of UNISOM II, depend very much on the resolve of the Somali parties to achieve political compromise.
 "The Council reminds the Somali parties that the future of their country lies in their hands and urges them once again to make every effort to advance the process of political reconciliation in Somalia.
 "The Council believes that the Secretary-General's proposed initial reduction of the UNISOM II troops is appropriate in the circumstances prevailing in Somalia.
 It stresses that priority attention should be given to ensuring the safety and security of UNISOM II and other international personnel, including the staff of non-governmental organizations.

 We look forward to cooperating with him in the Council's work.
 I am sure I speak for all members of the Security Council in expressing deep appreciation to Ambassador Vorontsov for the great diplomatic skill and unfailing courtesy with which he conducted the Council's business last month.
 We wish him well as he assumes his important responsibilities in his new functions.

 The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
 "The Security Council is deeply disturbed at continuing reports of acts of ethnic cleansing by the Bosnian Serb party in the Bijeljina area.
 It condemns this practice wherever it occurs and by whomsoever it is committed, and demands its immediate cessation.
 It further condemns all violations of international humanitarian law in the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, for which those who commit them are personally responsible.
 In this context, it calls for the full implementation of the agreement on the release of detainees contained in the 8 June 1994 Agreement concluded in Geneva.
 It notes with dismay that the Bosnian Serb party has not allowed the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to visit Banja Luka, Bijeljina and other areas of concern and strongly urges it to permit such access both to the Special Representative and to UNPROFOR.
 It also expresses its concern about continuing restrictions on access to Sarajevo, and in particular the closure by the Bosnian Serb party of the routes across the airport opened in cooperation with UNPROFOR following the 17 March 1994 Agreement."

 The President (interpretation from Spanish): The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
 The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
 The report of the Mission is contained in document S/1994/1009.
 It commends the mission for accomplishing its objectives, as set forth by the President of the Council on 4 August 1994 (S/1994/931).
 "The Security Council is satisfied, at present, with the pace of the peace process, including demobilization of all forces which will be completed shortly.
 It maintains a cautious optimism that Mozambicans will be able to fulfil the goals of the peace process, achieving democracy, lasting peace, and responsible, representative government in their country.
 It underlines the importance of ensuring that the voter registration process reach as many Mozambicans as possible.
 Those parties who have concerns about the implementation of aspects of the electoral process should pursue them through the National Elections Commission.
 The Council reiterates its intention to endorse the results of the Mozambican elections provided the United Nations declares them as free and fair and reminds all the parties of their obligation under the General Peace Agreement fully to respect these results as well as the principles of democracy.
 It notes with satisfaction that both the Government of Mozambique and RENAMO have accepted the fact that the initial size of FADM will be consistent with training and recruitment constraints during the pre-election period.
 The Council calls upon Member States to help provide military training and appropriate equipment to the FADM.
 "The Security Council expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for providing a detailed revised timetable for the phased withdrawal of ONUMOZ civilian and military personnel as set out in his report.
 The Council concurs with the Secretary-General that ONUMOZ should be deployed over a wider area of the country, keeping in mind the need to assist the Government in maintaining security, particularly in the crucial period before, during and immediately after the elections.
 "The Security Council notes the importance of ensuring that the Mozambican police have the resources required to maintain security in the country, in particular in the post-electoral period.
 "The Security Council invites the Secretary-General to report on the final disposition of the assets of ONUMOZ within the framework of the withdrawal of ONUMOZ.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Angola, in which he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 "The Security Council welcomes this development.
 By accepting the complete set of proposals, UNITA has met the requirements demanded in this regard in Security Council resolution 932 (1994).
 In this context and in view of the current negotiations, the Council has agreed not to consider, at present, the imposition of additional measures against UNITA as indicated in paragraph 26 of resolution 864 (1993).
 It urges both parties to reach such an agreement before the expiry of the present mandate of UNAVEM II on 30 September 1994.
 It reiterates its demand that the parties cease all offensive military actions and reminds them again that all such actions threaten the prospects for a negotiated peace.
 The Security Council stresses the importance of facilitating the free and unrestricted movement of humanitarian relief supplies and humanitarian assistance workers throughout the territory of Angola."
 The meeting rose at 1.25 p.m.
 It calls upon the international community to assist ECOWAS with the necessary resources to enable ECOMOG to fulfil its mandate effectively throughout Liberia.
 "The Security Council is following closely the situation in Liberia and in this connection welcomes the ongoing efforts, in particular those of the President of Ghana as Chairman of ECOWAS, to secure the release of the detained personnel."

 At the invitation of the President, Mr. Castaneda Cornejo (El Salvador) took a place at the Council table.
 The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
 "The Security Council has received the Secretary-General's report of 26 August 1994 (S/1994/1000) on the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL), submitted pursuant to resolution 920 (1994).
 "The Security Council welcomes the steps taken by the President of El Salvador, since his inauguration on 1 June 1994, to ensure compliance with the outstanding provisions of the Peace Accords.
 It notes that, while some delays and difficulties still persist, progress has been achieved in areas of the 'Agreement on a timetable for the implementation of the most important agreements pending' of 19 May 1994 relevant to the strengthening and modernization of the democratic institutions of El Salvador.
 "The Security Council reaffirms the need to ensure that, under appropriate verification by ONUSAL, the police and public security provisions of the Peace Accords are scrupulously observed.
 In particular, the Council expects that the Government of El Salvador will accelerate the demobilization of the National Police, as foreseen in the Peace Accords and as announced by the President of El Salvador.
 "The Security Council also shares the Secretary-General's concern at the limited progress of the land-transfer programme, delays and distortions in other reintegration programmes and the unresolved problem of the human settlements, which was originated in the course of the conflict.
 In this regard, it welcomes the unanimous election of an independent Supreme Court of Justice as an important step in the process of reform of the judicial system.
 "The Security Council welcomes the steps taken by the Secretary-General to reduce the size of ONUSAL to the lowest possible level of personnel and to contain its costs, consistent with the effective performance of its duties.
 The Council reaffirms the commitment undertaken by the United Nations to verify the implementation of the Peace Accords and, in this context, expresses the hope that significant further progress will be made in implementing the Accords".

 The President (interpretation from Spanish): The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on the agenda.
 The parties agreed to the provisional cessation of all hostile actions on the Tajik-Afghan border and inside Tajikistan with the assistance of United Nations military observers.
 It invites the Secretary-General to present urgently his views and recommendations regarding this request and other aspects of the implementation of the Agreement.
 The meeting was called to order at 5.10 p.m.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I have also received a request dated 23 September 1994 from Ambassador Dragomir Djoki_ to address the Security Council.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
 My delegation has decidedly mixed views with respect to the three draft resolutions before the Council.
 On the other hand, our opinion regarding the manner by which these draft resolutions have been brought before the Council is unambiguous.
 We do endorse the draft resolution contained in document S/1994/1083, which is intended to address the crimes of ethnic cleansing now being perpetrated against thousands of men, women and children in Serb-occupied areas of our Republic.
 We must raise two questions, though:
 None the less, I do hope that the UNPROFOR Commander in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is as successful in securing an invitation for his troops to Banja Luka as he has been in arranging for visits of foreign dignitaries to General Mladic.
 If UNPROFOR is to make a positive contribution to the peace process and its overall humanitarian mandate, it cannot limit itself to a traditional peace-keeping mission when there is no peace to keep and to waiting for invitations from the war criminals to stop their crimes.
 Otherwise, we are not impressed by projections of doomsday scenarios by those who now promote the continuing role of UNPROFOR as an excuse for reneging on their commitment to lift the arms embargo on our Government.
 We also support the spirit of the draft resolution contained in document S/1994/1084 on the enhancement of sanctions with respect to the so-called Bosnian Serbs.
 We, however, must question the effectiveness of this measure in securing the desired objectives, especially the reversal of the consequences of aggression and ethnic cleansing.
 We have proposed amendments that would be more likely to promote these latter goals, but they have been ignored by the sponsors.
 The reasons given for this ignoring of our proposals seem to reflect intra-Contact Group politics rather than the impact on the desired objectives and overall peace in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 We also must question the practical implementation of this draft resolution.
 How do we distinguish between the so called Bosnian Serbs and the Croatian or Krajina Serbs, who are not targeted by this draft resolution, but in fact do fully coordinate their activities?
 How do we separate the arm of the criminal conspiracy in Banja Luka from its brain, inspiration and torso in Belgrade?
 It is Belgrade's vision that is still now taking shape in occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 Which brings us to the third draft resolution, which is contained in document S/1994/1085, concerning the easing of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro.
 Our opposition to this draft resolution is not born out of habit or a desire to punish; it stems from our deep fears as to the consequences.
 This draft resolution lacks balance; for while it seeks to reward those who now have admitted to at least complicity in crimes and war-making, the victim is not assisted, even as promised, in confronting the still expanding and ongoing crimes and aggression and the consequences thereof.
 Thirdly, this draft resolution seeks to solely reward Serbia and Montenegro for a set of implausible, self-designed measures of self-policing.
 Serbia and Montenegro has not been required to endorse the peace plan by recognizing the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina within its current borders, an essential element of the Contact Group plan.
 Instead, Serbia and Montenegro is being rewarded for taking tactical steps that are designed to make it appear that Serbia and Montenegro is splitting from its offspring and agents.
 If the monitoring regime is structured in such a fashion as to be limited in its scope and distance of vision, then, like a man in a dark theatre, it will see only what is projected for it to see.
 The last conclusions are not advocated lightly.
 They are in fact supported by all of the processes that have brought us here.
 First, the self-designated Contact Group has placed a higher priority on the perception of its unity than on a real solution to the problem.
 Rather than proceed with measures that were initially committed to by the entire Group as part of the peace plan and its rejection by the Serbian side, they chose a road of avoidance when some members of the Group reneged on those initial commitments.
 Secondly, with some second thoughts on the part of one or two members that unfortunately did not prevail, the Contact Group as a whole has made the Security Council a rather convenient and self-serving chamber to relentlessly steer its programme and legitimize premature and inadequate measures.
 What is the urgency? Why are some so anxious to avoid the participation of our Presidents, Prime Ministers and Ministers who will be here next week?
 I suspect we all understand that this draft resolution is not defendable under the current circumstances and is an embarrassment to some.
 However, what is most embarrassing for all of us is that the urgency of Sarajevo's strangulation, the deliberate denial of water, electricity, gas and road access is accorded secondary priority to the parochial interests served by this draft resolution.
 An update on Sarajevo: its bakery has had to shut down and the people have now run out of bread.
 I suspect that many will agree with me that the Security Council itself is an unfortunate victim of this process.
 I also know that many of the members of the Council who are not sponsors will characterize their role as that of helpless bystanders.
 However, unless members confront this victimization of the Security Council, they will have to bear their share of the responsibility as victimizers.
 Simply put, I urge members not to support this draft resolution as structured and offered to them today.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the kind words he addressed to me.
 The next speaker on my list is the representative of Croatia, on whom I now call.
 Mr. Nobilo (Croatia): We wish to thank His Excellency, Mr. Yuliy Vorontsov, for the excellent way in which he steered the work of the Council during his presidency last month.
 From the very outset of the conflict in the region, Croatia has consistently pursued a policy which favoured political process over any other solution.
 We are firmly committed to the present peace process under the auspices of the Contact Group and we welcome the Group's plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 The Federation established between Bosnian Croats and Bosniacs has the full support of Croatia, and we call on the Bosnian Serb party to join these two parties in accepting the Contact Group peace plan as well.
 It is the only viable political solution that would avoid more horrific human suffering for all of the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 However, it is still too early to judge whether this decision is genuine and whether the measures undertaken are viable or sufficient, especially in view of the capacities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, political and real, in this regard.
 Therefore, my Government must express serious reservations about the draft resolution that would suspend some of the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at this time.
 The sanctions regime should be suspended only after the Council receives concrete and undisputed evidence about real progress on the ground, not only in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also in Croatia.
 The draft resolution can set a dangerous precedent in the region.
 A telling example of this cooperation is the recent offensive against the Council-declared safe area of Bihac.
 The offensive was coordinated "in-progress" from Belgrade, as was pointed out in the letter dated 16 September 1994 from my Foreign Minister to the Secretary-General, using assets from the occupied territories of Croatia and from the paramilitary units under the control of the Bosnian Serb authorities.
 Some members of the Council may have additional information in this regard.
 The Bosnian Serb authorities and the Serbs in the occupied territories of Croatia will continue replenishing their war machine in several ways.
 My delegation has already brought to the attention of the Council, in a letter dated 19 September 1994, one very likely way in which the border blockade is being violated: by air - violations which were reported by the Secretary-General on 13 September.
 We hope that the Council will not condone this new type of "no-fly zone" violations, as it already has a legal capacity to observe and prevent such violations.
 Another vehicle of replenishment of the Bosnian Serbs will be the proxies in the occupied territories of Croatia.
 We hope that the Council will take steps so that this serious problem can be addressed by the Monitoring Mission, and that the Mission will take steps consistent with resolution 820 (1993), which prohibits transshipments to the occupied territories in Croatia.
 "all relevant resolutions of the Security Council including those relating to the United Nations peace-keeping plan for the Republic of Croatia" (resolution 871 (1993), para. 5).
 Belgrade has continued its programme of integration of the occupied territories in Croatia into the legal, administrative and military systems of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
 My Government would support the suspension of the sanctions regime against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia under a clear programme that would take into consideration real progress on the ground and resolution 871 (1993).
 Should the Council decide in favour of this draft resolution, we must emphasize the importance of the ICFY monitoring Mission, which is operating with meagre resources and has been organized in hasty circumstances.
 The Mission must not be allowed to be used to satisfy short-term political goals.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of Croatia for his kind words addressed to me.
 Mr. Razali (Malaysia): It is a source of satisfaction and pleasure for my delegation to see you, Sir, presiding over the Council.
 We believe that to ease sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro at this juncture would be premature, unbalanced and counter-productive.
 We are deeply concerned over recent reports that there have been gross violations of the relevant Security Council resolutions, such as the unauthorized flights by Serbian helicopters over northern Bosnia.
 The flights could be carrying military supplies to the Bosnian Serbs.
 It is clear that the present strength of international observers is inadequate.
 According to studies conducted earlier, the number of people needed to police the border would involve 4,000 soldiers and a more restricted enforcement would require another 800 civilians.
 Malaysia is disappointed that important countries that have the capacity within the Council to apply judiciousness and proper consideration should permit such a precipitate action in furtherance of the objectives of a few which will only exacerbate the conditions of the Bosnians defending their country and trying to survive.
 We are as much intrigued as we are appalled by the haste to adopt this draft resolution.
 The international community cannot, in good conscience and judgement, ease sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro without taking simultaneous steps to relieve the difficult military and humanitarian handicaps that the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina continues to face.
 Clearly, before the aggressor is rewarded, the victim must at least be simultaneously assisted and relieved of the very ominous humanitarian, military and political consequences of the aggression that persists.
 Malaysia is of the view that, before any easing of sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro is initiated, the international community should ensure the following.
 The border monitors should comprise a cross-section of the international community and be effectively deployed in sufficient force. Serbia and Montenegro must recognize the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina within its current borders.
 Serbia and Montenegro should fully cooperate with the International war crimes Tribunal, including the surrender of wanted suspects for trial.
 The current safe areas/exclusion zones must be effectively defended.
 The Security Council should lift the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 Yet the five-nation Contact Group has failed to stand by its commitments.
 Yet what we are considering today is in sharp contrast to and a total reversal of what should have been done following the rejection of the peace plan by the Bosnian Serbs.
 We are alarmed by the accelerated campaign of "ethnic cleansing" being implemented by the Bosnian Serbs despite international condemnation, the more recent examples being in Banja Luka, Bijeljina and Prejedor.
 We wish to call for the immediate cessation of such activity wherever it occurs and whoever commits it.
 As we talk, the strangulation of Sarajevo by the Serbs continues. The people of Sarajevo have been denied water and power and even the food supply-line has been cut.
 Is it not a mockery and a travesty of justice that, while the so-called countries with influence remain ineffectual in assisting the victims, they would in turn want to rush to reward the aggressors?
 Malaysia wishes to express and underline its disagreement with the approach taken by the five-nation Contact Group.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of Malaysia for his kind words addressed to me.
 Mr. Kharrazi (Islamic Republic of Iran): Let me first congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of September.
 Your diplomatic skills have given us the confidence that the Council has been and will be guided effectively during the current month.
 We fully support the Security Council's strong condemnation of all violations of international humanitarian law, including in particular the unacceptable practice of "ethnic cleansing" by the Bosnian Serb forces, and its reaffirmation that those who have committed or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held responsible.
 The draft resolution in document S/1994/1084 is the Security Council's reaction to the incorrigible stance of the Bosnian Serb forces and their mockery of the entire international community.
 The draft resolution has the aroma of tightening sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs but not the taste, nor will it work to that end.
 The draft resolution in question falls hopelessly short of an effective decision on the part of the Council commensurate with the magnitude of Serbian atrocities and stubbornness.
 The Security Council is also discussing a draft resolution to ease the sanctions imposed by previous resolutions of the Council against Serbia and Montenegro.
 Some members of the Council have argued that the authorities in Serbia and Montenegro deserve leniency because of their decision to close the international border between Serbia and Montenegro and the Bosnian territories occupied by the Bosnian Serbs.
 The sponsors of the draft resolution must have assumed and subsequently portrayed to the international community that the closure of the border has already been effective.
 There is even information and documentation to the contrary.
 My delegation cannot accept the argument of the draft resolution's sponsors for easing the sanctions.
 There are widespread reports of several hundred flights by Serbian helicopters over the north-eastern part of Bosnia in the past week, many of which appear to have originated in Serbia.
 These flights are in gross violation of relevant Security Council resolutions.
 It is totally unjustified to reward the violators with the draft resolution at hand.
 "that the failure of the (European) Contact Group to honour its commitments would further encourage and embolden the aggressor to continue to defy the will of the international community with impunity."
 It will not be making a political step in the right direction.
 It is in fact a retreat on the part of the Security Council in the face of aggression, genocide and "ethnic cleansing", now combined with artful deception.
 Mr. Ciss (Senegal)(interpretation from French): The delegation of Senegal is happy to see you, Sir, presiding over the Security Council during the month of September, a task that you are performing with your usual talent and skill.
 I should like to extend to you our warmest congratulations.
 The peace plan submitted to the parties to the conflict by the Western Contact Group on 5 July this year had roused some hope that a peaceful and negotiated solution was finally within our grasp.
 Further, along with the Croat party, whose courage and political far-sightedness we should like here to hail, it has begun to move towards a federal solution capable of consolidating the peace and reconciliation to which all the inhabitants of the region so earnestly desire.
 Unfortunately, this peace initiative, like preceding ones, has been shattered against the usual wall of arrogance and blindness on the Serbian side.
 The rejection of the peace plan confirms that that party, as well as the forces which support it, have not relinquished their plans to achieve those goals that were at the very origin of the aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 These incidents seriously call into question the credibility of the claims by the Belgrade authorities regarding the closure of their borders with the territories occupied by their Bosnian Serb allies, and raise serious doubts about the effectiveness of the international observer force deployed on the ground.
 This is why my delegation believes that in the current circumstances any decision by the Security Council to relax the sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro would be premature, inappropriate and perilous, and likely to encourage aggression that violates the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter.
 The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina seems to us to be sufficiently confused, precarious and dangerous for us to appeal to the Security Council to guarantee, before taking any decision to relax sanctions, that such a decision will neither reward aggression nor help to perpetuate it.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of Senegal for his kind words addressed to me.
 The Bosnian Serbs' continuing opposition to the various peace plans, including the most recent one of the Contact Group, is undeniably a rejection of the fundamental values underlying international relations between civilized countries.
 As regards the draft resolution condemning "ethnic cleansing", I must say that we have already spoken out on a number of occasions against this forcible, inhuman and medieval method of usurping the territory of other people.
 As for relaxing sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), as provided for in the third draft resolution, we are convinced that approving that proposal would soon lead to irreversible consequences and result in an escalation of the conflict.
 We maintain that any relaxation of sanctions will be abused; it will help the Belgrade regime and prolong the crisis that led to the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, this bloody chapter in modern history.
 Apart from all that, my Government firmly believes that what is happening in Bosnia and Herzegovina is only the most obvious - and definitely not the sole - manifestation of the crisis.
 In those areas the international observers are long gone, having been driven out by the Yugoslav authorities, but the alarm bells are still ringing.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of Albania for the kind words he addressed to me.
 I would also like to express our appreciation for the leadership shown by your predecessor, Ambassador Vorontsov.
 The ongoing fighting and bitter hostilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina pose a serious threat to international peace and security, causing immense and unacceptable human suffering.
 Our aim was and still is to exert the strongest possible pressure in order to bring an end to the war and tensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina through a negotiated settlement.
 On 6 July, the Contact Group submitted a proposal for a territorial settlement to the parties, offering a viable and realistic basis for a peaceful solution.
 The European Union welcomes the fact that the proposed territorial settlement has now been accepted in full by all sides except the Bosnian Serb party, and strongly urges this party to do likewise.
 The European Union and its member States firmly believe that the three draft resolutions on which the Security Council is about to take decisions constitute an important step in the international peace effort. In essence, these decisions by the Council will convey an unequivocal message to the Bosnian Serbs.
 First, we condemn the "ethnic cleansing" which the Bosnian Serbs have systematically carried out in the areas they occupy.
 This persistent and systematic campaign of terror must stop immediately and those responsible must he held personally accountable.
 In this context, we again emphasize the importance of the work of the International Tribunal set up to punish crimes in the former Yugoslavia.
 We therefore fully support the draft resolution elaborated by the non-aligned members of the Security Council.
 Secondly, the Bosnian Serbs must realize that they will remain totally isolated as long as they block the peace process and continue the abhorrent practice of "ethnic cleansing."
 Thirdly, with regard to the third draft resolution, concerning the suspension of certain sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), we are united in our view that the decision of President Milosevic to close the border deserves a positive reaction from the international community.
 Of course, we must have positive proof that the border with Bosnia is and will remain closed to all but humanitarian supplies, in particular to weapons and fuel.
 We welcome the arrangements made for the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia (ICFY) Mission, as contained in its initial report, which aim to determine clearly and unequivocally whether or not the border closure is implemented.
 Thus, through the adoption of the three draft resolutions, the Security Council will emphasize today that those who choose the course of peace will receive our support and those who persist in rejecting peace and embracing war will be isolated and prosecuted.
 The draft resolutions that will be put to the vote today need a chance to prove their effectiveness. Time is now required for the peace process to achieve the desired tangible results, even though we would all prefer immediate results.
 It would be a tragic mistake to undermine the search for a negotiated settlement by decisions that could have dangerous and unforeseeable consequences.
 The members of the European Union believe that the time has now come for the international community to support in full unanimity the intensive peace effort currently under way.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of Germany for his kind words addressed to me.
 The next speaker is the representative of Egypt.
 I invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his statement. Mr. Elaraby (Egypt) (interpretation from the Arabic): Thank you Mr. President.
 We are fully confident that your well-known wisdom and leadership abilities will yield the desired results in the Council's consideration of the international crises before it.
 I should also like to express my thanks to your predecessor, Ambassador Vorontsov, the former permanent representative of the Russian Federation, for his valuable efforts during his presidency of the Council last month.
 We are about to create an historic precedent: unable to stop aggression, the international community will have resigned itself to accepting a fait accompli, thus allowing the fundamental aspects of the question to become obfuscated.
 The purpose of the Council's meeting today is to review the sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).
 First, what has become of the Council's earlier resolutions with respect to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)? Those resolutions contained provisions and demands that should have been implemented and complied with before a review of sanctions.
 Have those resolutions been nullified?
 Secondly, has the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia recognized the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as an independent State within internationally recognized borders, so that the Belgrade authorities may be exonerated with respect to the causes and development of the military conflict in Bosnia?
 Such intensive air sorties cast doubt on the seriousness and commitment of the Belgrade Government with regard to closing its borders with the Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 If the Belgrade Government has really cut its ties with the Bosnia Serbs, why will it not agree to effective international military monitoring of its borders with Bosnia and Herzegovina, as called for by the Council in resolution 838 (1993)?
 If the Council takes this step, it will be sending a wrong signal which would have major negative repercussions.
 The United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), in which my country participates, is stationed on the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to protect that territory and its population, especially since declared safe areas have been disarmed in accordance with Council resolutions.
 Finally, the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has shown flexibility and has cooperated with the international community.
 It has accepted all the successive stages of the plans of peaceful settlement.
 It is time for the Council to pause for reflection, to ponder its responsibilities under the Charter, and to review its earlier unimplemented resolutions adopted under Chapter VII before it adopts a draft resolution that would relax the sanctions.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of Egypt for the kind words he addressed to me.
 Mr. Batu (Turkey): It gives me great pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of September.
 We are confident that under your able guidance the Council will successfully carry out its responsibilities.
 Yet, despite our calls and other similar appeals, numerous Security Council resolutions still remain unenforced.
 The strangulation of Sarajevo and other safe areas cannot be stopped.
 There are three draft resolutions before the Council.
 The first draft resolution, which is contained in Security Council document S/1994/1083, deals with the persistent and systematic campaign of terror and "ethnic cleansing" perpetrated by the Bosnian Serbs.
 It is vital that these draft resolutions be adopted immediately and implemented effectively.
 However, we have serious doubts about the timing and content of the third draft resolution, contained in Security Council document S/1994/1085.
 Serbia's claim that it has closed its borders with the Serb-held areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina has to be checked effectively.
 We have observed only a symbolic step in this respect.
 The International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia (ICFY) Mission to Serbia and Montenegro was established a few days ago, on 17 September.
 The scope and status of this Mission are not clear.
 How they could control a very long border with such limited manpower and resources is a question which should be answered adequately.
 Despite all these legitimate questions and outstanding issues, we have been provided with a "quick fix" report two days after the establishment of the Mission.
 The conclusion of this report is in direct contradiction with the reports of independent sources that there have been continuing unauthorized helicopter flights between Serbia and Montenegro and the Serbian-held areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 At a time when the campaign of "ethnic cleansing" has been accelerated and the stranglehold on Sarajevo and other "safe areas" has been intensified, the easing of sanctions on Serbia will constitute yet another wrong signal sent to the aggressor and will undermine the peace process.
 We must focus our energy on how we could create effective and meaningful enforcement measures for the implementation of the latest international peace plan, which was again rejected by the Bosnian Serbs in defiance of the will of the international community.
 The five-nation Contact Group committed itself, in case of rejection, to the tightening of sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro.
 Now we are moving in the opposite direction.
 We are concerned that this will be a further blow to the credibility of the international community.
 We call upon the international community to stand at long last by its commitments and start acting accordingly.
 In this context, we are expecting true and effective border-monitoring, measures in response to the intensified strangulation of Sarajevo, the expansion of the exclusion zones and appropriate steps towards lifting the de facto arms embargo on the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 We strongly urge the Serbian side to stop its genocidal campaign to consolidate its territorial gains and to accept the peace plan.
 If they fail to do so, the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina should be provided with all the means necessary to exercise its inherent right to self-defence.
 Mr. Djoki_: The Security Council is considering today the partial suspension of the sanctions imposed against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
 We see this as an important step that is opening new prospects for the acceleration of the peace process in the area.
 On 30 May 1992, by resolution 757 (1992), the Security Council imposed sanctions against the citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, unjustly singling them out as the sole culprits for the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 One hundred and twenty weeks have gone by since this unprecedented verdict was passed on an entire nation, without even a right of appeal.
 Thus, the constitutionally guaranteed right to self-determination - one of the fundamental human rights granted to all other peoples of the former Yugoslavia - was denied only to the Serb people.
 The international community is well aware of the fact that the key decision-makers on the recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina subsequently conceded that such a decision was wrong and premature and that it directly contributed to the tragic chain of events that followed.
 "that the international community made a mistake because it allowed the break-up of Yugoslavia before the problem of internal republican borders was addressed".
 Mr. Henry Kissinger, former United States Secretary of State, said in a commentary in The New York Times of 25 February 1993, that Bosnia was not a nation except in a geographical sense.
 He added that there were no Bosnians per se and that it remained unclear why it should ever have been thought that the same ethnic groups which had refused to coexist in a relatively large Yugoslavia would be able to coexist in tiny Bosnia.
 These statements, though belated, confirmed the position that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has advocated from the very onset of the Yugoslav crisis.
 At the time when the sanctions were imposed against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for alleged aggression, not a single member of the Army of Yugoslavia was outside its territory.
 The international community acknowledged soon after the imposition of sanctions that the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina is not a consequence of involvement by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but a true civil war, with elements of inter-ethnic and inter-religious conflict.
 The sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were not only kept in place, but were strengthened, although as was widely recognized the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia clearly supported all major peace initiatives of the international community.
 Even though the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has never accepted the reasons for which the sanctions were imposed in the first place, it fully cooperated with the international community and has met all the conditions contained in the Security Council resolutions.
 The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has continually made efforts to reach a peaceful and negotiated solution to the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 It should be recalled that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia supported the so-called Cutileiro plan for the political and territorial arrangement of Bosnia and Herzegovina, signed by all three ethnic communities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, before the onset of the tragic conflict.
 However, even though the Muslim side accepted the plan at the beginning, it subsequently withdrew its approval, under the influence of certain foreign Powers.
 Ignoring this fact and in spite of it, by its resolution 820 (1993) the Security Council decided to tighten the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
 That plan was also rejected by the Muslim side.
 The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia used all its influence with the Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina to persuade them to accept the Plan of Action of the European Union, based on the Juppe-Kinkel initiative, which they did.
 The following question should be asked: how was it possible, then, that the sanctions were imposed only against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, while Croatia has deployed its regular forces in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina with total impunity?
 The Federal Government has asked the Bosnian Serb leadership to show its commitment to peace and the peace process by taking an unequivocal, positive stand on the Contact Group's proposals.
 In the choice between accepting a compromise peace or an escalation of the war, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has never hesitated to choose the option of peace.
 The plan in fact makes official the Bosnian Serb entity by acknowledging the Serb Republic and guaranteeing its borders with the Croat-Muslim federation.
 It is of particular importance that it has been agreed that the Bosnian Serb entity can establish confederal ties with Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, just as the Croat-Muslim federation has been allowed to establish confederal links with the Republic of Croatia.
 This offer of the Yugoslav Government has been accepted, and members of the humanitarian Mission of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia are already in the field.
 Further insistence on the collective punishment of the people of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, coupled with the insistence of certain countries on the lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina, is an absurd policy.
 It would inevitably further inflame the conflict, with unforeseeable consequences, not only for Bosnia and Herzegovina, but for the region as a whole, which, we are confident, cannot be the goal of the Security Council.
 The decision to open for civilian transport the airport in Belgrade and the ferry service between Bar on the Montenegrin coast and Bari in Italy and suspend the sanctions in sports and culture is certainly a step in the right direction, though very modest in scope.
 International cooperation in sport, culture and science represents a significant part of the heritage of mankind, and should not be subject to any barriers.
 It is therefore very unfortunate that the conditions are set for the ultimate and absolute lifting of all sanctions exclusively in the function of maintaining political pressure.
 The international community, through the Security Council, continues the practice of punishing the citizens of a sovereign country for events over which it has no control.
 Any solution that is not satisfactory to one side will only further escalate the conflict.
 Any other option is fraught with risks and unforeseeable consequences, not only to the warring parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina but to the international community as a whole.
 Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be achieved through one-sided accusations and irrational demands to lift the arms embargo from one party to the conflict.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): The next speaker is the representative of Canada. I invite her to take a place at the Council table and to make her statement.
 We know you will bring great skill and fairness to the task.
 I also congratulate and thank your predecessor, the former Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation, for his excellent conduct of the work of the Council during the month of August.
 A few hours ago, following an extensive debate in Parliament, the Canadian Government announced that it would renew its current contribution to the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) for a period of six months.
 Our own peace-keeping tradition heightens our concern that the United Nations and Canadian peace-keepers should be a force for peace, not an excuse for inaction or delay.
 We understand that there is no shortcut to a durable and fair settlement.
 All sides must abandon the military option and the expectation that weapons will achieve more than negotiations.
 We therefore oppose a lifting of the arms embargo because we are convinced that it would escalate this conflict, end the humanitarian mission of UNPROFOR and push back the prospects for peace.
 We believe that the draft resolutions before the Council today represent small but significant steps towards a negotiated solution.
 The draft resolution easing sanctions on Belgrade is a challenge to Serbian leadership in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia: "Stand by your commitments".
 We say to Belgrade: "We welcome your acceptance of the Contact Group plan because it is key to your winning back the confidence of the international community.
 There must be no easing of border controls or leakage, particularly with military-to-military contacts and along the Montenegrin border.
 Canada is pleased that the Security Council is choosing to approve increased sanctions on Pale while condemning "ethnic cleansing" in Banja Luka and Bijeljina.
 Canadians have considerable experience on the ground in Bosnia, Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
 We know that it will be difficult to achieve lasting peace.
 Our decision to renew our contribution to UNPROFOR bears witness to our commitment to the United Nations and the principles of our Organization.
 The Contact Group has proposed a framework that would allow the parties to cast off the cruel logic of war.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of Canada for her kinds words to me.
 Mr. Bataineh (Jordan) (interpretation from Arabic): I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council this month.
 We are quite sure that, thanks to your competence and wisdom, you will conduct the Council's proceedings successfully.
 Our thanks go also to your predecessor for the successful manner in which he conducted the Council's work last month.
 Regrettably, this tragic situation is affecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that Member State and has inflicted many violations of human rights on its people, the victims of waves of ethnic cleansing with their attendant atrocities of mass murder, rape and trampling of human dignity.
 My delegation has spoken on this matter in every meeting held by the Security Council and everyone is familiar with our point of view.
 We speak here of the Council's tendency to reward the indirect aggressor, Serbia and Montenegro, and to strengthen the position of the direct aggressors the Bosnian Serbs by allowing them to tighten their grip on their victim.
 There are dangerous elements involved here that relate to the grave imbalance in the balance of power between the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Moslems.
 We must not ignore also the press reports on sorties by Serbian helicopters over northern Bosnia over the past few weeks.
 In short, any review of the sanctions regime against Serbia and Montenegro must embrace other concomitant measures that would, include effective border monitoring by the international community and aerial surveillance.
 Serbia and Montenegro must also recognize the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina within its present borders.
 Failing this, Serbian acceptance of the peace plan will be no more than a tactical ploy.
 The Council must also reconsider the lifting of the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia as a means of forcing the Serbs to accept the peace plan and of enabling Bosnia to face the situation of siege and occupation.
 In the very least, since none of this has been done, and the exact opposite may well be done, the measures I have just indicated should be put in place before any relaxing of sanctions on the Serbian side, takes place.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of Jordan for the kind words he addressed to me.
 Our appreciation goes also to your predecessor, Ambassador Vorontsov, for the noteworthy work he accomplished when he was the President of the Council during the month of August.
 What Ambassador Sacirbey said is important, not only with respect to the position to be taken by Council members when these draft resolutions are voted on, but also for the future.
 Likewise, the Ambassador of Croatia and the Ambassador of Albania have given us very important information - information that is very reliable because they are on the spot in this region.
 Another speaker, Ambassador Djoki_, also expressed his desire to see an acceleration of the peace process, but he accused the Security Council of taking actions on the basis of prejudice and on erroneous premises.
 The draft resolution contained in document S/1994/1083, regarding "ethnic cleansing", has come very late in the day, and indeed there is an element of paradox here in terms of priorities.
 This draft resolution was, undoubtedly, deserving of a certain priority.
 The draft resolution contained in document S/1994/1085, which calls for the relaxation of the sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro, is clearly premature.
 It is a hasty initiative that was put together before there were adequate guarantees that earlier evils would not be repeated.
 Border closings - effectively implemented - are clearly necessary in places where Serbia has a common frontier with areas occupied by the Bosnian Serbs.
 Controlling the situation on the ground remains a key practical problem.
 What is provided in this draft resolution does not seem to convince the Council that the territory is secure.
 Obviously, there is also the question of food, electricity and other such necessities, to which our colleague from Bosnia-Herzegovina referred.
 There is a draft resolution that should have been before us but which is not, and that is one lifting the arms embargo - arms which the Bosnians need for their legitimate defence.
 No embargo remains valid under international law if there is clear proof that maintaining the embargo in question promotes genocide.
 Recent events in the north of Bosnia and Herzegovina testify to this fact.
 Mr. Rahman (Bangladesh): I join my voice with those of others in congratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency for this month.
 My delegation would also like to pay tribute to your predecessor, Ambassador Vorontsov of the Russian Federation, for the manner in which he conducted the work of the Council last month.
 Speaking at this late stage in the debate, I will be brief.
 The past history of armed aggression, genocide, the series of acts that have led to indiscriminate bombings, the use of poisonous gases, "ethnic cleansing", the continuing violation of international humanitarian law shows that in this region human suffering is still writ large.
 We have all welcomed the cease-fire arrangements in Sarajevo and surrounding areas.
 Yet the violations of the cease-fires, the use of heavy artillery, the indiscriminate attacks on the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) personnel still continue.
 The common aim of enforcing a comprehensive cessation of hostilities and of extending safe havens all over Bosnia and Herzegovina is far from being realized.
 We have all repeatedly reaffirmed our support for the territorial integrity and political independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 A vital corollary to this affirmation is that all actions and declarations made under duress with regard to land ownership be declared null and void, thus facilitating the return of displaced persons.
 In light of the situation, and while we support the strengthening of measures to tighten sanctions and the draft resolution on "ethnic cleansing", Bangladesh believes that any resolution that would lead to the easing of sanctions would not only be premature but also counter-productive.
 The stated objective of the international community has been to assist the parties in achieving a negotiated settlement acceptable to all sides.
 In view of the past history of backtracking and duplicity, which has resulted in creeping dismemberment of Bosnia and Herzegovina, we believe that we must intensify rather than ease the pressure for a settlement.
 We believe that anything less would be tantamount to appeasement and be a setback in efforts towards a negotiated settlement.
 The President: I thank the representative of Bangladesh for his kind words addressed to me.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 At the invitation of the President, Mr. Abdellah (Tunisia) took the place reserved for him at the side of the Council Chamber.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): The next speaker is the representative of Tunisia.
 Mr. Abdellah (Tunisia) (interpretation from the French): On behalf of my delegation, allow me first to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for the month of September and on the exemplary manner in which you are guiding its work.
 We would have liked for this lofty body, after all the resolutions it has adopted and after all the appeals it has made to the Serbian party to abide by international law - to have conducted a thorough review of its actions and the realities on the ground.
 It would have then come to the conclusion that its numerous demands on the aggressor had not produced the slightest result.
 It is not a situation that would seem to justify easing the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, which is solely responsible for this gangrene spreading through Europe and threatening international peace and security.
 Only yesterday we all heard that Bosnian air space had been violated by military aircraft dispatched by Belgrade - not for the purpose of distributing assistance, not for the purpose of uncovering abuses, but simply to sow terror among the inhabitants and to defy international public opinion.
 The United Nations would lose much of its authority if, in the guise of imposing new sanctions against the aggressor, it were to lift sanctions designed to make it change its policy and abandon its annexationist aims and inhumane practices.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of Tunisia for the kind words he addressed to me.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 Mr. Olhaye (Djibouti): At the outset, Sir, I wish to congratulate you most warmly on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for this month.
 We are confident that your sound diplomatic skills will continue effectively to guide us.
 With over three years of hostilities in Bosnia behind us, it is still impossible to discern patterns of action by the major players and to anticipate what, if anything, to expect next.
 The Contact Group has fashioned a land settlement plan which, although flying in the face of nearly every Council resolution condemning aggression and the acquisition of territory by force as unlawful and totally unacceptable, nevertheless awards the Bosnia Serbs 49 per cent of the land of Bosnia.
 In the expectation, no doubt, that the difficult party would be the Bosnian Government, the message was sent that terrible consequences would befall the side that refused this final proposal.
 Almost unexpectedly, the Bosnian Government accepted the proposal, while the Bosnian Serbs rejected it outright.
 We are now witnessing the familiar repetition of history and events in Bosnia.
 We might add to this long list the closing of the "blue route", the only access road for United Nations convoys.
 We might also mention the defiant movement of heavy weapons into weapons-exclusion zones, and the open violation of the ban on flights in the no-fly zones.
 Even the Red Cross has labelled the situation as intolerable, abominable and a negation of the roots of humanitarian law.
 With history as their guide, the Bosnian Serbs obviously seek to panic the international community.
 They intend first to draw attention away from their rejection of the settlement plan and then to make us attempt to appease them with yet another offer.
 After all, with over 50 resolutions adopted but seldom enforced, the official acceptance of the territorial settlement proposed by the Contact Group naturally faces a similar fate.
 One of the draft resolutions before us calls for the partial lifting of sanctions against the former Republic of Yugoslavia as a reward for its promise to enforce new sanctions against Bosnian Serbs.
 We hope that becomes a certainty.
 These are some of the crucial issues that ought to have been substantially addressed before embarking on this fortuitous exercise of easing sanctions, an exercise which we find very troubling, untimely and unjust.
 In view of the unabated belligerence and total defiance of the Bosnian Serbs and their persistent pursuit of the abhorrent practice of "ethnic cleansing", sanctions against them are clearly imperative, and my delegation therefore will support the relevant draft resolutions before us.
 However, we have many grave problems and doubts with respect to the draft resolution calling for partial lifting of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro in advance of actual performance and demonstration of good faith.
 We have found little consolation in the reports of new violations, particularly the hundreds of military flights at night.
 To reward such behaviour would violate the remaining honour the United Nations retains in this whole episode.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of Djibouti for the kind words he addressed to me.
 The international community should continue to urge the conflicting parties to resolve their dispute through peaceful negotiations.
 We are of the view that the international community should encourage all the efforts for peace made by all those concerned, including the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
 The two draft resolutions before us, on condemnation of the violations of international humanitarian law and on suspension of sanctions, reflect in principle China's basic position in this regard. We will therefore vote in favour of both drafts.
 It is on the basis of this principled position that we will abstain in the vote on the draft resolution on tightening sanctions.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of China for the kind words he addressed to me.
 Mr. Kovanda (Czech Republic): Allow me too to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of office for the month of September and to assure you of the continuing support of our delegation.
 I should also like to thank Ambassador Vorontsov, the former Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation, for his skilful management of the Council's work last month.
 Today we are meeting for perhaps the most significant of the several meetings we have had this year concerning the former Yugoslavia.
 We have in front of us a collection of no fewer than three draft resolutions, which, to our mind, constitute a package.
 Having earlier signalled our support for the draft resolution condemning ethnic cleansing, my delegation is proud to co-sponsor the other two draft resolutions as well.
 We accord the Bosnian Serbs the dubious distinction of having enriched the vocabulary of our respective languages with this term.
 The world could have lived with a poorer vocabulary, I am sure.
 Not only has ethnic cleansing not ceased, it has escalated in recent weeks, so much so that The New York Times, for one, has described its recent episodes, in the areas of Banja Luka and Bijeljina, as the worst in almost two years.
 The Council reiterates the personal responsibility of the perpetrators of ethnic cleansing.
 The International Tribunal on the former Yugoslavia, slowly though it may be grinding its way to justice, will surely get there.
 We warn Pale: they do not have a free hunting licence to perpetrate any imaginable outrage in the territory they control.
 Even so, the Bosnian Serbs have rejected every single proposal international negotiators have come up with for ending the war.
 Most recently, they have rejected the territorial settlement proposed by the Contact Group.
 This proposal, too, is not perfect.
 This proposal, too, is nothing better than possibly the best bad deal possible.
 But its blanket rejection by the Bosnian Serbs has broken the limits of international tolerance and patience.
 Therefore, the next draft resolution we are considering imposes additional sanctions on Bosnian Serbs.
 The time for political talks is over.
 They have elected to become international pariahs. Well, then, so be it: that fate is their choice.
 Economically, they will be strangled.
 Their economic intercourse with the rest of the world now becomes illegal; their financial assets will be frozen.
 Nevertheless, the draft resolution takes care not to choke off humanitarian supplies of food, medicine and clothing.
 There is one way out for Pale: accept the territorial settlement proposed by the Contact Group.
 While the Bosnian Serbs have been intractably intransigent, there has been a change in the stance of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) which I will call FRY for short.
 Additionally, in a measure underscoring the significance of this shift, it has decided to close its border with Bosnia and Herzegovina and to allow international observers to monitor this border.
 In this context we wish to express our appreciation to the efforts of participants in the International Conference on Former Yugoslavia to have FRY's international border monitored as effectively as possible, and also to those countries that have promised or have already sent personnel to aid in this effort.
 Thus, for the first time since the beginning of hostilities, the political direction of the FRY is uncoupled from that of the Bosnian Serbs.
 This development deserves recognition by the international community, and such recognition is awarded in the third draft resolution before us today.
 It proposes an easing of sanctions against the FRY.
 The leadership of the FRY has been very unhelpful in the past and we will not forget this any time soon.
 It will have to do a lot to win any greater degree of confidence of the international community. One further helpful step, for example, would be to recognize the independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in its international borders, which our draft resolution mentions.
 This is a concern that we understand especially well.
 After all, the Czech Republic emerged from a double process of disintegration of multinational entities, one in 1918 and one in 1992.
 The carnage, mayhem and humiliation prevalent in the region has finally got to stop.
 Mr. Marker (Pakistan): It is with great pleasure that I extend to you, Sir, my delegation's warm congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the current month.
 We are confident that with your diplomatic skills and wide experience, of which we already have considerable evidence, you will continue to steer the work of the Security Council with distinction.
 As for the draft resolution contained in document S/1994/1085, my delegation has the most serious reservations.
 We strongly condemn and deeply deplore the Bosnian Serb party for its refusal to accept the proposed territorial settlement, which has been accepted in full by the Bosnian Government and the others concerned.
 Defying the will of the international community, the Bosnian Serb party has continued its campaign of "ethnic cleansing" and genocide against the non-Serb population, particularly the Muslims, and has continued to consolidate its hold on territories seized through the use of force.
 Recent reports from a variety of reliable sources indicate an intensification of the campaign of "ethnic cleansing" by the Bosnian Serbs, particularly in Banja Luka, Bijeljina and Prejedor.
 Furthermore, the Serbs have been blatantly violating the no-fly zone by conducting hundreds of helicopter flights between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the Serb-held areas in Bosnia.
 While Chapter VII resolutions on Bosnia are being violated with utter contempt the international community has stood by silently.
 In return, Serbia and Montenegro is getting what it wants.
 It is abundantly clear that a handful of monitors cannot certify the uncertifiable - that Mr. Milesovic has actually cut off links with his Bosnian Serb proxies.
 But even if several more monitors were to be sent to police this extremely porous border, it would still not justify the course of action suggested in the draft resolution under consideration.
 The international community should not be hoodwinked by a cosmetic gesture of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia authorities to allow a limited monitoring of its borders with Serbian-held areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 It should not forget that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) was the author and abettor of despicable crimes against the civilian population in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is directly responsible for the carnage and massacres of civilians in Bosnia over the last 27 months.
 It has to date not accepted or recognized the sovereignty, territorial integrity and international borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a State Member of the United Nations.
 My delegation is not prepared to consider even the partial lifting of sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia unless and until the consequences of its aggression in Bosnia and Herzegovina are reversed and territories occupied by the use of force are surrendered.
 This would, in our view, undoubtedly undermine the peace process and sacrifice the principles of justice and equity enshrined in the United Nations Charter.
 Before considering such a move, the Security Council should at least have taken appropriate measures to relieve the prevailing humanitarian catastrophe in Sarajevo.
 Further measures should have been adopted to declare the entire 51 per cent territory allocated to the Muslim-Croat federation as a "safe area".
 We consider the timing for the submission of this draft resolution to be most inopportune, inappropriate and premature, and are convinced that it would be counter-productive for the peace process.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of Pakistan for his kind words addressed to me.
 Mr. Bakuramutsa (Rwanda) (interpretation from French): My delegation takes this opportunity to congratulate and thank you, Sir, for assuming the presidency of the Security Council at the moment when Rwanda resumed its seat in the Council.
 The delegation of Rwanda has reviewed all the resolutions adopted by the Security Council on Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as the various presidential statements made on this subject.
 It is in this light that my delegation participated in and supported the drafting of the draft resolution contained in document S/1994/1083, submitted by the non-aligned caucus.
 It is also in that context that my delegation supports the Contact Group in the draft resolution it has submitted in document S/1994/1084; we fully subscribe to that draft resolution.
 As to the draft resolution in document S/1994/1085, submitted by the Contact Group, following consultation with my Government my delegation should like to inform the Council that it presents many advantages and equitable elements for both groups concerned.
 Accordingly, my delegation has no quarrel with the contents of the draft.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of Rwanda for his kind words addressed to me.
 Mr. Mim\x{5daa} (France) (interpretation from French): The adoption of the three draft resolutions before the Council could mark a turning-point in the handling of the Yugoslav crisis.
 Indeed, in these three decisions, the Council, we hope, will be taking note of a basic change that came about in August.
 The territorial settlement proposed by the Contact Group has now been accepted by all parties concerned, with the exception of the Bosnian Serbs.
 It is therefore essential that we encourage them to continue in this direction.
 Everyone is aware that the latter are determined to do anything to impede progress in the diplomatic process and that they ardently hope for a general resumption of hostilities.
 On the one hand, some hope that this will lead to some hypothetical outside military intervention which everyone knows would most likely come too late.
 On the other hand, some would see here an opportunity to extend their territorial gains and thus realize their fantasy of a Greater Serbia.
 France has consistently stated that this lifting of the arms embargo would be a solution born out of despair.
 For the Bosnians, it would mean military defeat, further exodus, more suffering for their people and perhaps the vanishing of any territorial base for the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 Any possibility of a negotiated solution acceptable to the international community would be put off to some distant future.
 We hope that after months of blindness all parties to the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina will resolutely commit themselves to it.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of France for his kind words addressed to me.
 I shall first put to the vote the draft resolution contained in document S/1994/1083.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): There were 15 votes in favour.
 The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as resolution 941 (1994).
 I shall now put to the vote the draft resolution contained in document S/1994/1084.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): The result of the voting is as follows: 14 votes in favour, none against and 1 abstention.
 The draft resolution has been adopted as resolution 942 (1994).
 I shall now put to the vote the draft resolution contained in document S/1994/1085.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): The result of the voting is as follows: 11 votes in favour, 2 votes against and 2 abstentions.
 The draft resolution has been adopted as resolution 943 (1994).
 Your diplomatic skills and great knowledge will be a guarantee of success in our work.
 The policy of intimidation adopted in Bosnia and Herzegovina against the population on the basis of ethnic or religious background has been profusely documented and described in those reports.
 Similarly, we reaffirm the right of all displaced persons to return in peace to their former homes.
 In due course all these actions will be subject to judgement by the International Tribunal and responsibility will be decided upon on an individual level.
 For those reasons the Republic of Argentina fully associates itself with the resolution the Security Council has just adopted in document S/1994/1083.
 In this connection we urge the reluctant party to accept the solution proposed by the Contact Group, to reconsider its position and to re-evaluate the benefits that would accrue from peace.
 That is what the Council has done in the resolutions it has adopted today.
 Hence, they both have significant political and symbolic value.
 We believe that this has always been the purpose of the Council, and it has continued to pursue it today with the adoption of these three important resolutions.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of Argentina for his kind words addressed to me.
 Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): Allow me at the outset to add my voice to the words of congratulation to you, Sir, and also to sincerely thank all those colleagues who have transmitted their good wishes to my predecessor, Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsov.
 I will not fail to transmit those kind words to him.
 The three resolutions adopted today by the Security Council reflect a turning-point in the efforts by the international community to find a peaceful settlement to the bloody conflict in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.
 This development is largely due to the positive reaction of the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the plan for the territorial settlement for Bosnia and Herzegovina prepared by the Contact Group.
 This positive reaction was backed by concrete steps: the decision to close the border with regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina controlled by the Bosnian Serbs to all shipments, apart from humanitarian ones, and also to invite international assistance for the passage over the border of basic humanitarian supplies.
 I want to stress in particular what is contained in operative paragraph 5 of resolution 943 (1994): the possibility that the Council would consider further steps to ease sanctions in the light of further progress in the situation.
 We also deem exceptionally important the instruction to the Sanctions Committee to adopt appropriate streamlined procedures for expediting its consideration of applications concerning legitimate humanitarian assistance to the former Republic of Yugoslavia.
 The quickest way to achieve that is to support the territorial settlement plan as a necessary first step to a comprehensive solution.
 Russia deems the policy of "ethnic cleansing" to be repugnant.
 Together with other members of the Council, we demand its immediate cessation.
 Accordingly, the Russian delegation supported the adoption of the resolution that condemns the policy conducted by the Bosnian Serbs of expelling non-Serbs from the territory under their control as well as gross, heinous violations of international humanitarian law.
 Unfortunately, this practice is typical of other parties to the conflict as well.
 Russia, therefore, notes in particular the provision of the resolution that condemns any "ethnic cleansing", of whatever origin, and whoever might perpetrate it.
 We deem it extremely important that all parties to the conflict take very seriously this firm opinion of the Security Council and should prevent any hostilities, violations of international humanitarian law or provocations in this decisive period for the peace settlement.
 Russian attaches great importance to further joint efforts by the countries of the Contact Group and the development of their interaction with the Security Council and with other countries on the basis of the experience accumulated in recent months.
 The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina remains dangerous.
 Military confrontation is still going on; people are dying; innocent civilians are suffering.
 We deem it essential to step up pressure on all parties and to use all available opportunities to move towards a comprehensive peace settlement.
 This settlement, we feel, should be based on the territorial settlement plan and also on the constitutional principles that place all parties on an equal footing.
 In the light of the appeals to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina, we take a position of principle here that any measure suggested to the Council should be evaluated in the general context of the settlement process.
 Russia has repeatedly stated its vehement disagreement with the demand to lift the embargo, since this step would propel Bosnia and Herzegovina into an abyss of even more bloodshed.
 We continue to believe that this extremely undesirable measure is fraught with a number of very adverse consequences, one of which would be a curtailment of the United Nations peace-keeping operation.
 In conclusion, allow me, on behalf of the Russian delegation, to express the conviction that the resolutions adopted today will make a meaningful and very important contribution to the attainment of a peaceful settlement for the former Yugoslavia.
 Mr. Valle (Brazil): Allow me at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council.
 Your well-known professional and personal qualities assure us that the Council will successfully tackle the difficult questions before it.
 We shall continue to abide by our rejection of any policy based on intolerance, violence and destruction, by respect for the Charter and for compliance with all relevant Security Council resolutions.
 Mounting evidence, however, has been recently pointing to the very real prospect of a further deterioration of the dismal situation in Bosnia.
 Under such circumstances, we consider it urgent that the Council take additional concrete action in support of those who demonstrate their readiness to pursue the path of peace.
 It is with great distress that we have learned, in the past few days, of renewed military activity causing further civilian casualties in Bosnia.
 Our dismay has been compounded by reports from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and other sources of continued systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law in the area.
 As the President of the ICRC stated recently, horror is still a daily fact of life in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 The atrocities associated with the abhorrent practice which has been termed "ethnic cleansing" continues to claim new, innocent victims.
 We had been hopeful that the proposals by the Contact Group might have led to agreement between the parties on a negotiated settlement, redressing the tide of violence.
 To our disappointment, however, the unwillingness of one of the parties to embark on this genuine effort for peace has prevented the initiative from yielding the results that the international community had hoped for.
 Nevertheless, this attitude is still recent, and its sincerity must withstand the test of time.
 It is perhaps still early to consider whether or not it is a turning point in the behaviour of one of the major parties in a dispute which has been marked by persistent reluctance to compromise by all parties.
 Brazil supported the three resolutions that have just been adopted and stands ready to assist in their implementation.
 The Committee established by resolution 724 (1991) should continue to play its important role in overseeing sanctions as well as in ensuring the distribution of legitimate humanitarian aid to the afflicted.
 It is indeed regrettable that we should still be dwelling on ways to exert pressure on belligerent leaders whose actions only underscore their failure to propose a dignified future for their people.
 We remain hopeful, nevertheless, that dialogue and reason will eventually prevail over the roar of weapons in the former Yugoslavia.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of Brazil for his kind words addressed to me.
 Sir David Hannay (United Kingdom): I would like to begin by congratulating you, Sir, on the assumption of your office and thanking your predecessor, Ambassador Vorontsov.
 The three resolutions this Council has just adopted should be seen as a coherent part of an overall approach.
 At the heart of the three resolutions is the Council's backing for the territorial settlement contained in that proposal, which has been accepted in full by all the parties concerned, with the exception of the Bosnian Serbs.
 It is their refusal to accept it which has brought upon them the additional targeted sanctions contained in the second of the three resolutions.
 It has also led to President Milosevic's welcome decision to close the border between Serbia and Bosnia to all supplies other than humanitarian ones for the Bosnian Serbs.
 The suspension comes into effect only when the Secretary-General reports that the Mission established by the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia (ICFY) has certified - and the word is carefully chosen - that the border is effectively closed.
 The role of that Mission is thus a crucial one.
 The Co-Chairmen of the International Conference on Yugoslavia and their staff have done an excellent job in mounting it with such speed.
 We call on all parties to the conflict in Bosnia to work for peace in the difficult months ahead.
 The close co-operation between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), which we saw yesterday in action with the use of close air support near Sarajevo, can and will continue.
 My countryman, the great eighteenth-century historian, Edward Gibbon, once said that "history is largely a chronicle of the crimes, follies and misfortunes of mankind".
 The resolution rightly reiterates that those responsible for it are accountable before the International Tribunal now at work in The Hague.
 That the practice is folly is just as self-evident.
 This war is one from which none of us can escape.
 For the sake of the victims, and to avert a worse catastrophe, the international community must intensify its efforts to bring a just and lasting peace to Bosnia.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of the United Kingdom for his kind words addressed to me.
 Mrs. Albright (United States of America): Please accept, Sir, our congratulations on, and gratitude for, accepting the presidency this month.
 Your careful work and diplomacy have been most helpful in guiding us through our work.
 We would also like to thank Ambassador Vorontsov for the excellent work he did in his final month as the representative of the Russian Federation on the Council.
 My Government has always emphasized that the Bosnian Serbs and the Government in Belgrade had to choose between two paths.
 The second led to peace, the lifting of sanctions, and reintegration into the international community.
 The parties in the former Yugoslavia should doubt neither our determination to punish those who choose conflict, nor our willingness to rebuild constructive relations with those who choose peace.
 This Council is meeting in the shadow of two key events.
 First, the Bosnian Serbs rejected the Contact Group's proposed territorial settlement in Bosnia.
 The resolutions this Council has just adopted are, taken together, a response to those two developments.
 Their message is twofold: first, they aim to pressure the recalcitrant party, the Bosnian Serbs; and, secondly, they demonstrate this Council's determination to use both carrots and sticks to move the parties towards a negotiated settlement.
 In tightening sanctions on the Bosnian Serbs we are tightening the noose around the aggressors in Bosnia.
 These sanctions are not punitive.
 The proof of that will be evident when you, the Bosnian Serbs, take the necessary steps to bring this conflict to a peaceful, negotiated conclusion and thereby begin your return to the norms of the international community.
 While we welcome the first indications that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia might have changed course, we do not take this decision lightly.
 Belgrade's long-term intentions are not yet clear.
 And that is why we are not basing this decision on trust.
 We are demanding strict verification.
 Our willingness to extend the suspension beyond 100 days will depend on Belgrade's conduct over the next four months.
 We note that this resolution will preserve the integrity of existing sanctions on material goods as contained in other Security Council resolutions.
 In order that the continued suspension not come into question, these flights will need to be strictly monitored to prevent their being used to circumvent other sanctions that remain in place.
 The people of Serbia and Montenegro should understand that further concrete steps towards peace will lead to additional easing of sanctions.
 In that regard, we urge Belgrade to recognize Croatia and Bosnia within their internationally recognized borders, and to use its influence with the Croatian Serbs to push them towards a settlement consistent with Croatia's territorial integrity.
 The Belgrade Government should also understand that a decision to once again choose conflict will stop even this limited sanctions relief and lead to the adoption by this Council of even tougher measures.
 Let me reiterate my Government's firm view that we cannot wait indefinitely for the Bosnian Serbs to change their minds.
 If Pale does not agree to the peace plan by 15 October, we intend to seek a resolution in the Council to lift the arms embargo.
 We understand the pain that more fighting might bring, but there is a choice: the peace plan can be accepted by the Bosnian Serbs.
 Its message to the Bosnian Serbs is the same: until you accept and live by the norms of civilized society, until you agree to live in peace, you cannot and you will not be welcomed as members of the international community.
 My Government is increasingly disturbed by the Bosnian Serbs' attempts to increase pressure on Sarajevo.
 Violations of Sarajevo's status as a safe area, and continued violations of the exclusion zone around the city, cannot and will not go unpunished.
 You have already demonstrated your great diplomatic skills and attention to detail with the efficient and exemplary manner in which you have been conducting the affairs of the Council.
 I should also like to convey my delegation's gratitude to Ambassador Vorontsov of the Russian Federation for the skilful, very dignified and pleasant manner in which he conducted the affairs of our Council during the month of August.
 We wish him all the best in his new assignment.
 The three resolutions we have just considered and adopted have been described as a package.
 This is indeed a package, but a package that is still not properly balanced, given the situation on the ground in Bosnia and Herzegovina even as we are considering this subject today.
 Our resolution on "ethnic cleansing" addresses a very serious issue which has attracted the condemnation of the international community.
 We are grateful that it was possible to adopt this draft resolution.
 It is appropriate that this resolution was adopted under Chapter VII, for the Council cannot remain indifferent to grave violations of international humanitarian law.
 In our 2 September 1994 statement on the subject, we condemned this practice and demanded its immediate cessation.
 We also condemned all violations of international humanitarian law.
 Unfortunately - but consistent with its pattern of utter contempt and disregard for the wishes of the international community - the Bosnian Serb party did not heed our statement.
 The Bosnian Serb leadership should be reminded that the International Tribunal has jurisdiction over serious violations of international humanitarian law and that those who have committed grave acts against innocent civilians will eventually be brought to justice.
 My delegation believes that there is no other solution that is viable or durable except through a peacefully negotiated settlement.
 In the view of my delegation, the Contact Group proposals provide a good basis for such an outcome.
 History teaches us that the political advantage to be derived from the hardline military position of the Bosnian Serbs and their rejectionist stance are temporary and cannot be sustained for much longer.
 We therefore call on all members of the international community, especially neighbouring States and particularly the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to discharge their obligations under this resolution in order to ensure a complete and total isolation of the Bosnian Serb political and military leaderships.
 The resolution on the loosening of sanctions gives my delegation a lot of unease, primarily because of its timing.
 In general, we support ways and means to encourage the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to take further steps towards full compliance with its obligations to implement all relevant Security Council resolutions aimed at tightening sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs.
 However, the context in which we have considered the draft is one that we would have wished were different.
 This is because whatever action we take in this body has a symbolic significance that sometimes goes beyond the actual measures.
 That the Council is considering loosening sanctions when nothing has changed on the ground in terms of continuing military activity and the strangulation and bombardment of many towns and villages in Bosnia and Herzegovina is clearly capable of giving the wrong impression.
 Let me be clear about one thing however: sanctions are never a welcome development.
 At the same time, however, when positive steps which address fundamental issues are taken by a party to a conflict, such steps should in our opinion be acknowledged so as to encourage further positive steps that they might take.
 However, in this particular case, a fundamental and minimum condition for this easing of sanctions will have been an immediate and explicit recognition of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina within its internationally-recognized borders.
 This will also be consistent with the Contact Group Plan.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of Nigeria for his kind words addressed to me.
 The Security Council has taken action today on three draft resolutions.
 New Zealand supported the adoption of all three.
 That root cause is the insistence of some groups and factions to live in an ethnically homogeneous State, or one in which the control exercised by one community is so absolute that it might just as well be ethnically homogeneous.
 That insistence runs directly counter to the purposes and principles of this Organization, and, if taken to its logical consequence, would undermine the very foundations which bring us together in this house.
 What makes ethnic cleansing so appalling is that it is systematically directed.
 It is not just occurring through random individual acts, although these are bad enough.
 The evidence is compelling that the purported authorities in the districts where ethnic cleansing is occurring are using it as a principal instrument of their long-term policy.
 It is an instrument of terror; it is the weapon of cowards.
 And those who use it must understand that they will not be able to reap any reward from these actions.
 To the contrary, they will one day face international justice before the Tribunal which is now functioning in The Hague.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have reported that the non-Serb population in Serb-held areas suffers in a particularly cruel way from this practice.
 The dislocation of population from Bosnian Serb-controlled territories has been immense.
 The measures embodied in this resolution again give a clear message to the Bosnian Serbs and a clear direction to the United Nations.
 In rejecting that settlement, the Bosnian Serbs have again wilfully defied the international community and asked for further measures to be adopted against them.
 What makes their decision even more culpable is that by their rejection they have condemned their neighbours and the innocent populations of the region to a perpetuation of the conflict.
 An end to the killing and suffering in Bosnia is achievable.
 A balanced and reasonable peace plan is on the table.
 But if greed, arrogance and a determination to retain by force what they have gained by force prevails, they will face total isolation from the world.
 The increased sanctions included in the second resolution comprise a number directed at the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs and at all who continue to aid and abet them.
 If saner counsels are to have any hearing among them, either the leaders must change their views or the leaders must be changed.
 President Milosevic has accepted the Contact Group peace plan as a fair settlement.
 To this end, he has closed the international border between Serbia and Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina and cut off all but humanitarian supplies to the Bosnian Serbs.
 New Zealand has welcomed this change of policy, and we supported the resolution adopted today.
 But let us be clear: all that this suspension involves is the restoration of sporting and cultural links and of two communications routes; the full weight of economic sanctions remains.
 There should be no doubt that this limited step is a direct consequence of a positive decision by President Milosevic.
 Despite this development, the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina is still bleak, with continuing hostilities and a deteriorating security situation.
 We believe that efforts have to proceed on several fronts if this situation is to be halted, let alone reversed.
 Responses to the situation in Bosnia which would complicate the objective of a peaceful settlement should be approached with extreme caution.
 I include in that category a decision to lift the arms embargo.
 We strongly believe that the package of measures contained in today's resolutions should be allowed time to have an effect before any further, drastic step is taken.
 Mr. Al-Hassan (Oman) (interpretation from Arabic): At the outset, allow me, on behalf of my delegation, to express to you personally, Sir, and to your friendly country, Spain, sincerest congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month of September.
 We are confident that your knowledge of international affairs and your diplomatic skills fully qualify you to lead our deliberations with wisdom and skill and in a manner that will promote the noble objectives of our Organization.
 We pledge you our full cooperation for the achievement of those ends.
 All reports and information available to us show that the Bosnian Serbs persist in practising the abhorrent policy of "ethnic cleansing" against all non-Serbs, particularly Muslims in all those parts of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that are under their control.
 In so doing, they resort to all manner of inhuman practices ranging from the killing of innocent women, old people, and children, mass expulsions, rape as a weapon of war, the demolition and burning of homes and arbitrary detentions.
 All such atrocities continue to be practised against the defenceless people of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 The Security Council, in resolution 713 (1991), has deprived the Bosnian people of the legitimate right of self-defence enshrined in the Charter of the Organization.
 All this has enabled the Serbs, over the past three years, to persist in such practices under the very eyes and noses of the international peace-keeping forces in the area, in close proximity to where such events continue to take place.
 My delegation voted in favour of draft resolution 941 (1994) which the Council has just adopted.
 Such options, were they implemented, would provide a good basis for peace and stability in the region as a whole and in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in particular.
 We also trust that it will not in any way contradict the legitimate demands of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 We should like, however, to stress our position that the lifting of sanctions must be subject to a trial period in order for us to gauge the peaceful intentions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).
 Should there be no concrete progress acceptable to the international community and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the measures called for in the resolution would become null and void and the situation would revert to its earlier status.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of Oman for his kind words addressed to me.
 We are concerned, too, by the recent increase in military activity in the area of Bihac, with the participation of the Serbs of the Krajina region of Croatia, and the resurgence of hostilities in other areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially in Sarajevo.
 However, even in this we are discouraged by the rejection by the Bosnian Serbs of the territorial arrangements proposed by the Contact Group and accepted by the other parties concerned.
 We have always been particularly concerned over the fate of the civilian population in Bosnia and Herzegovina, be it the Muslims, Croats or Serbs.
 Even the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is usually very reserved in its public statements, issued a press release on 19 September which states, inter alia:
 "The expulsions continue to occur on a massive scale, despite the repeated denials of the highest Bosnian Serb authorities."
 In the resolution I mentioned, we also reaffirmed the principle of the individual responsibility of the perpetrators of such acts, who will in due course have to answer to the International Tribunal established for that purpose, which is already at work in The Hague.
 A lasting solution can be obtained only in a negotiated framework and, in the current circumstances, the plan for territorial settlement submitted by the Contact Group is an indispensable premise for a comprehensive settlement to the conflict.
 The third resolution adopted - resolution 943 (1994) - provides for a provisional, limited and revocable suspension of certain sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) as a result of its acceptance of the peace plan and its decision to break with the Bosnian Serbs.
 We believe that the three resolutions adopted today by the Council, viewed together, reflect the prevailing change in the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina and create a new dimension to the handling of that conflict.
 We express the hope that the Bosnian Serbs, faced with total isolation, will reconsider their attitude to the proposals of the Contact Group and put an end to their unacceptable conduct in the area once and for all.
 It is only by remaining united and persevering that we will one day glimpse the light at the end of the tunnel.
 There are no further speakers inscribed on my list.
 The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
 Mr. Christopher (United States of America): Mr. President, distinguished members of the Security Council, Mr. Secretary-General, colleagues and friends, I am particularly honoured by the presence of each of you this morning and thank you for your attendance and attention.
 I am pleased to have an opportunity to review with you the status of our joint efforts in Haiti.
 The Security Council, of course, continues to play a vital role in giving Haiti and the people of Haiti a chance to take back their destiny.
 Our shared determination is to deliver tangible results: The Haitian military leaders will step down.
 Legitimate government will be restored.
 Since the 1991 coup, this Council has viewed the overthrow of democracy in Haiti as a threat to regional security and to international norms.
 We recognized our responsibility to stand together for stability and the restoration of democratic government in the Western Hemisphere.
 Together, we explored every avenue to achieve a peaceful resolution.
 We negotiated in good faith.
 We imposed and then strengthened sanctions against Haiti.
 For almost three years, these military leaders met our efforts with defiance and disdain.
 In 1993, General C\x{5dae}ras signed the Governors Island Agreement, which had been negotiated under United Nations auspices.
 But thereafter he refused to implement the accord.
 Three months ago, the military leaders expelled the monitors sent by the United Nations and the Organization of American States to encourage respect for human rights in Haiti.
 As we all know, Security Council resolution 940 (1994) and the multinational coalition that it authorized are an expression of our collective resolve.
 An expanding coalition of 28 nations, so geographically diverse as to include Bangladesh and Bolivia, has been forged in pursuit of a common cause.
 This coalition is in the best tradition of the United Nations. It is grounded in principled diplomacy and it is backed by the determination to use force if necessary.
 Our willingness to exercise military force, pursuant to resolution 940 (1994), has allowed us to reach an agreement for the peaceful restoration of democracy that has made the Mission safer for our coalition and for the Haitian people.
 As leader of the multinational coalition in Haiti, the United States values and depends upon close coordination and consultation with other Member States.
 To that end, today I want to report to the Council on our progress to date; I hope this will be a very up-to-date report.
 As the Council knows, the first 3,000 soldiers stepped off their helicopters and landing craft on 19 September, less than two weeks ago.
 Among the immediate priorities was to secure the airport in Port-au-Prince and the seaports around the country.
 With the transportation hubs under control, we have moved nearly 42,000 tons of supplies into Haiti.
 Hundreds of coalition forces are in training in Puerto Rico, on their way to oversee and monitor the police in Haiti.
 With the coalition's deployment, the time has come to prepare for the resumption of normal economic activities in Haiti.
 The United States and Haiti have introduced, with President Aristide's support, a draft resolution in the Council to lift completely United Nations sanctions when President Aristide returns.
 By adopting this draft resolution, we will reinforce Haitian democracy and we will signal our readiness to support Haiti's recovery as soon as democratic government is restored.
 In addition, the United States will lift all unilateral sanctions on Haiti except those targeted on the coup leaders and their named supporters.
 We urge other nations that may have unilateral sanctions to consider and take similar steps.
 Hundreds of Haitians, now reassured that they can walk their streets, sleep in their homes without fear and speak their minds, have voluntarily left Guantamo since 26 September to return to Haiti.
 We are confident that with President Aristide's restoration many more will make the right choice and go back to their homeland.
 I believe that political developments in Haiti are a reason for cautious optimism.
 Two weeks ago, President Aristide eloquently demonstrated his commitment to democracy when he said very forthrightly that the true test of a democracy is in its second free election.
 He also said that he would not be a candidate for re-election in the campaign, but would ensure that the election took place.
 In recent days and weeks he has repeatedly called for a spirit of reconciliation, and he has been making frequent radio statements urging the people of Haiti - his supporters - to remain calm and not to disrupt the peaceful transition.
 President Aristide has also called the Haitian Parliament into session, with the amnesty law as the first order of business.
 As the Council knows, the Parliament began its deliberations only yesterday.
 It is interesting to remember and important to note that only two weeks ago many Haitian parliamentarians were in hiding, fearful for their lives, and many were also in exile.
 Another hopeful step will be occurring today: Mayor Evans Paul of Port-au-Prince, who has been barred from City Hall by armed thugs for the last year, will reclaim his rightful office.
 I think we can all take satisfaction in the superb efforts of the coalition forces in Haiti.
 We should remember that only two weeks ago elements of the Haitian security forces and the attach\x{5ee5} were free to intimidate the public with impunity.
 Today, coalition forces allow Haitians to enjoy their first respite from terror in three years.
 I do want to note, however, that the international community has taken on a very serious challenge in Haiti.
 Our courageous troops will face difficult, and sometimes dangerous, situations; that moment is not yet completely past.
 There will be risks, even setbacks, and we must be ready for them.
 But we must know that we have the plans and the determination to move ahead - and we will.
 Twelve observers from the United Nations Mission are already in Haiti to plan for the coordination of this important change.
 They are working closely with General Shelton of the coalition forces.
 Our mission in Haiti reminds us once again of the importance of United Nations peace-keeping operations.
 The United States is providing $1.2 billion for peace-keeping this year, a step which will bring up to date our arrearages and be a major step towards meeting our overall obligations.
 We have also proposed reforms to improve the way in which the peace-keeping operations are financed, equipped and organized.
 The multinational coalition will establish, and the United Nations Mission will help maintain, a secure environment in Haiti.
 But the broader international community must provide Haiti with the economic, humanitarian and technical aid that will spur development and consolidate democracy.
 As members of the Council know, an intensive and extensive humanitarian assistance programme is already under way.
 Food, medicine and medical supplies are being distributed.
 Sanitation is being improved.
 One of the striking things for us in the United States has been to witness the technical expertise that President Aristide has assembled in planning for his return.
 I think we can draw some confidence from the way that that has been undertaken and planned.
 But our effort here must be part of a larger undertaking, and we look to other nations and the international financial institutions to respond rapidly and generously.
 The importance of supporting Haiti's recovery and reconstruction in the months ahead cannot be overstated.
 Haiti is the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, and one of the poorest in the world.
 But Haiti is not a State without institutions or without promise.
 The coalition's mission is not to reinvent or to provide new institutions, but to create conditions that will allow Haiti's legitimate institutions to return.
 The hard work of rebuilding Haiti rests with them and with Haiti's democratic leaders, who fully understand what their responsibilities and obligations are.
 In closing, I wish to reaffirm the indispensable role that the international community has played in bringing Haiti to this hopeful point.
 By our joining together in strength, the burden that each of us must bear is reduced and the prospect of overall success is increased.
 Our nations understand that the best way to achieve our goal is by acting together.
 As the Council is aware, France voted unhesitatingly for that resolution because we were aware that only a radical solution could make it possible to get this crisis off dead centre.
 Today, therefore, we can contemplate with some hope the situation in Haiti.
 After three long years of usurpation of power by the military, during which the principles of democracy were flouted, human rights were violated, the economy was devastated and the agreements signed never respected, the people of Haiti can finally hope to resume their journey towards democracy and development.
 It must be respected, and the presence of several thousand troops and police is a guarantee that it will be.
 In the streets, fear has started to recede; in the parliament, political life has resumed since the Haitian deputies were finally able to meet yesterday at an inaugural meeting, and it should now begin to discuss the legislative texts needed to pursue the process of democratization in the country.
 The adoption of these texts was a part of the Governors Island Agreements, which were and remain the basis of France's policy towards Haiti.
 In a few weeks, perhaps - or even, we hope, in a few days - the legitimately elected President will return to his country and to his people.
 France which, together with the other Friends of Haiti meeting at the United Nations with the Secretary-General, has constantly been making efforts to permit legality to be restored to that country, is gratified with this result.
 We hope that this return will mark a new era of peace, justice, democracy - which implies the organization of elections in accordance with the timetable laid down - economic recovery and, in particular, national reconciliation.
 The time has now come for Haiti to regain its rightful place in the international community.
 France believes that now a very clear political signal needs to be sent out by a decision, as has been proposed, to lift the sanctions in accordance with the Security Council resolutions, a decision which will take effect the day after the return of President Aristide to Port-au-Prince.
 My country has long-standing historic ties with Haiti and, as is known, will contribute 100 police officers and gendarmes to the United Nations mission.
 We are also prepared to resume bilateral cooperation programmes as soon as conditions make this possible.
 Thus, according to what President Aristide himself has said, Haiti can now resume its journey from destitution and poverty to the recovery with dignity and with the assistance of the international community.
 This is earnestly desired by France.
 Mr. Cardenas (Argentina) (interpretation from Spanish): Permit me very briefly to express my thanks to the Secretary of State of the United States for his update on developments concerning the multinational force in Haiti.
 Our contribution to that force is a contingent of gendarmes who will act as police monitors.
 They are already in Puerto Rico and, as of next week, will begin their work on Haitian soil.
 Immediately afterwards, medical personnel and engineers of the Argentine armed forces will arrive in Haiti.
 Similarly, two ships of our navy will supplement their verification tasks under the embargo imposed by the Council, which it has been carrying out for months, with logistical support for the multinational force.
 We believe that the present situation is a positive one and that we are closer than ever to the solution foreseen by the international community, in keeping with the Charter of the United Nations and the will of the legitimate Government of Haiti.
 In this regard, we eagerly await the return of President Aristide so that the sanctions imposed on Haiti can be lifted.
 We hope that a resolution foreseeing that eventuality will be adopted by this Council in a matter of hours.
 The people of Haiti has noticed that the hope of escaping from its past is beginning to materialize.
 The Argentine Republic is pleased to be able to contribute to this cooperative effort to restore to Haiti its plundered sovereignty.
 This has been very useful.
 We have taken note that a traumatic military operation was avoided.
 Nevertheless, I must express my concern and the concern of my Government over the very fact that foreign military forces are deployed in the territory of a Latin American country.
 Of course, my country will not fail to support the democratic reconstruction of Haiti in full respect of its sovereignty and in compliance with the principles of non-intervention and self-determination.
 We listened with interest and attention to his statement, which has brought clarity to the situation in Haiti and to the activities and objectives of the presence in that country of the multinational force authorized under Security Council resolution 940 (1994).
 We hope that task of the multinational force can be carried out as foreseen.
 We are on the eve of the restoration of the legitimate authorities of Haiti and the return of President Aristide as foreseen in the Governors Island Agreement.
 In and of themselves, these two circumstances do not protect Haiti from prevailing dangers and political threats, or from difficult economic and social realities.
 They are of crucial importance nevertheless as a point of departure on the road to hope which we share today with the entire Haitian nation.
 I should like to assure them all of the complete cooperation of the Haitian Government during this delicate transition.
 We hope that, over the coming days, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide will be back in Haiti.
 When that happens, the Haitian Government will have to address itself immediately to an extremely difficult situation.
 That said, and until this afternoon's meeting, we wish to express the support of the Haitian Government for the initiative contained in the draft resolution to be submitted with a view to lifting the sanctions the moment President Aristide is back in Haiti.
 The meeting rose at 10.50 a.m.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I should like to inform the Council that I have received letters from the representatives of Canada and Venezuela, in which they request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 At the invitation of the President, Mrs. Frechette (Canada) and Mr. Manzanares Veloz (Venezuela) took the places reserved for them at the side of the Council Chamber.
 Members of the Council have before them document S/1994/1109, which contains the text of a draft resolution submitted by Argentina, Canada, France, Haiti, Spain, the United States of America and Venezuela.
 The first speaker is the representative of Haiti, on whom I now call.
 After three long years of disappointment and frustrated hopes, the positive developments that we have been witnessing in the situation in Haiti for the last two weeks justify our feeling of optimism and our belief that the tragedy of the Haitian people is approaching its end.
 This morning, the Mayor of Port-au-Prince, Mr. Evans Paul, resumed his functions after having been prevented from carrying them out by attach\x{5ee5} and members of the FRAPH paramilitary group, who had threatened his life.
 The disarmament of the Army and the paramilitary forces has begun.
 High-calibre weapons have been confiscated, and the conduct of the police has markedly improved.
 Today hope is being reborn in Haiti.
 My Government, which has always called for these measures, is fully satisfied with this new course of events.
 This positive development has prompted the Security Council to consider the lifting of the sanctions imposed by its resolutions 841 (1993), 873 (1993) and 917 (1994).
 However, this measure should take effect after the return to Haiti of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
 My Government supports this decision, which, in fact, President Aristide, in his statement of 25 September, invited the Council to consider.
 We fervently hope that the members of the Council will unanimously adopt the draft resolution before it.
 But we have not yet achieved this objective.
 It would be naive, even irresponsible, on our part to hail a victory while the military are still in control of the country.
 Despite the presence of the multinational force, acts of violence directed at the population continue.
 The paramilitary forces continue to sow death.
 A grenade was thrown into a crowd which was demonstrating following the reinstatement of the Mayor of Port-au-Prince.
 This grave incident demonstrates the need for the multinational force to speed up disarmament in order to create a stable and secure environment which would make possible the national reconciliation that we desire so much.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): The next speaker is the representative of Canada.
 Mrs. Fr\x{5db0}hette (Canada) (interpretation from French): It is with a feeling of hope that my delegation is addressing the Council today on the question of Haiti.
 The multinational coalition authorized by the Security Council has been deployed peacefully and is making progress in establishing a secure and stable environment.
 Recent developments in Haiti are for the most part positive, although we deplore the acts of violence directed against the supporters of President Aristide.
 Preparations are under way for the redeployment of the International Civilian Mission in Haiti.
 Next week, an advance team will go to Haiti to prepare for deployment of the United Nations Mission, which will assist Haitians in their efforts to build peace and to establish a stable and democratic society.
 It is in this promising context that we fully endorse the draft resolution to be adopted by the Security Council today, which will lift the sanctions regime following the return of President Aristide.
 It is a clear signal of hope to the Haitian people that the international community remains fully committed to the restoration of democracy in Haiti and stands ready to help Haitians in the challenges of economic recovery that lie ahead.
 For its part, Canada, at President Aristide's request, has already lifted its unilateral ban on commercial air services with Haiti and on financial transactions, except those targeting the military leadership and their supporters.
 We fully support his call for a spirit of reconciliation and cooperation as Haiti moves to take its rightful place among the circle of democratic nations.
 In the past three years, Canada has provided over $41 million in humanitarian aid.
 We now stand fully ready to help Haitians face the daunting task of rebuilding their society.
 We will provide substantial financial and technical assistance to this end.
 The Security Council's action today prepares the way for the international community to help Haiti and the Haitians, following President Aristide's return, to build their future.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 Mr. Sardenberg (Brazil): Since the beginning of the crisis in Haiti, Brazil has lent its consistent support to the diplomatic efforts aimed at restoring democracy to the sister country of Haiti, a member of the Latin American and Caribbean Group of States.
 Our goal has been clear: the re-establishment of constitutional rule, with the return to power of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide through peaceful means.
 The immediate end to the suffering of the Haitian people should be a clear priority and must remain at the core of our concerns.
 At the last meeting of the Security Council, the Foreign Minister of Brazil stated our position on this issue.
 In this sense, my delegation has reservations on certain elements of the current draft resolution that go beyond the question of the termination of sanctions.
 With the restoration to power of President Aristide, assistance to Haiti in the task of national reconstruction will be crucial, and Brazil stands ready to actively participate in it.
 We reaffirm that sanctions will be lifted only when the legitimately elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, returns to Haiti and resumes his duties.
 By voting today and not waiting for President Aristide's return, the international community's message is clear: there will be no conciliatory gesture while the military remains in power, but when President Aristide and democracy return to Haiti, Haiti can return to the community of nations.
 Let me be clear. My Government believes that voting today is the right choice.
 By voting today, we promote the early departure of the coup leaders, the early return of President Aristide and thus the early restoration of democracy to Haiti.
 Today, the Haitian people enjoy their first respite from terror since the coup that ousted President Aristide on 30 September 1991, three years ago tomorrow.
 In this regard, we must note the brave efforts of the members of the multinational force deployed, peacefully and without bloodshed, only two weeks ago.
 As noted by Secretary of State Christopher in his remarks to the Council this morning, this draft resolution reinforces Haitian democracy.
 With it, we take a crucial step towards our common goals: the departure from power of the de facto leaders, the restoration of Haiti's legitimate government and the return of President Aristide.
 The hard part now begins: Haiti stands at a crossroads and will require the full support - economic, political and technical - of the international community.
 Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): The Russian delegation is abstaining in the voting on this draft resolution on the lifting of sanctions against Haiti.
 While supporting the humanitarian direction of this draft, we still have doubts regarding its hasty adoption, and we set out these doubts in detail in the Council's earlier consultations.
 However, we decided not to object or vote against its adoption, since in this case it is a question of improving an acutely difficult humanitarian situation and alleviating the extreme suffering of the Haitian people.
 We note that these forces are making every effort to establish peace and stability in Haiti so as to make it possible to restore a democratic government and to ensure the return of President Aristide.
 It is appropriate to recall that, in undisputed questions such as the removal of sanctions from the South African Republic, the Council's decision was prepared and adopted only after the implementation of all the necessary conditions and procedures.
 The Russian delegation intends to promote such an approach in the consideration of questions relating to the lifting of the sanctions regime. We do so, based on the conviction that double standards are inadmissible in the work of the Council.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I shall now put to the vote the draft resolution contained in document S/1994/1109.
 Against:
 Abstaining:
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): The result of the voting is as follows: 13 in favour, none against and 2 abstentions.
 The draft resolution has been adopted as resolution 944 (1994).
 Mr. Mim\x{5daa} (France)(interpretation from French): It was with a feeling of hope that my delegation voted in favour of this resolution by which the Council decided to lift the sanctions against Haiti on the very day following the return of President Aristide.
 I am pleased that this resolution was co-sponsored by the legal Government of Haiti.
 France never gives its support lightheartedly to coercive measures against a country.
 The lifting of the sanctions regime will in our view make it possible to consolidate democracy by ensuring the development of the country.
 I recall in this respect that, as the French Minister for Foreign Affairs stated this morning, we are also going to lift the sanctions which we had adopted unilaterally when the technical conditions so permit.
 The Chinese delegation believes that the Security Council should, in handling other, similar cases, adopt a practical attitude to facilitate an appropriate solution as it has done in lifting sanctions against Haiti.
 It is our consistent view that the only way to a lasting peaceful settlement lies in dialogue and negotiation.
 Mr. Cardenas (Argentina) (interpretation from Spanish): We are particularly gratified to have been able to co-sponsor the draft resolution that the Council has just adopted.
 In our view it is a tangible sign of hope, although fully in accordance with the letter and spirit of the earlier resolutions of the Council on Haiti.
 In lifting the sanctions against Haiti immediately after the return of the constitutional President to his country we are heralding what appears to be the end of a traumatic stage in the life of that country, and the nascent roots of the democratization of the Haitian people.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I shall now make a statement in my capacity as representative of Spain.
 Let me first reflect on this morning's meeting of the Council, which featured the participation of ministers representing various Council members.
 Ten days ago, by virtue of this Council's authorization, contained in resolution 940 (1994), a multinational force entered Haiti.
 Their efforts, designed to implement the objectives of the international community in Haiti, deserve the appreciation of that community, which they are representing in their work.
 For some time it appeared that the activities of the multinational force would take place in tragic circumstances, inasmuch as the de facto authorities in Port-au-Prince had been persistently defying the international community, failing to fulfil their commitments under the Governors Island Agreement and Security Council resolutions.
 Fortunately, the understanding reached by the United States authorities and the de facto authorities in Haiti has changed the immediate context of the international action.
 The Governors Island Agreement provided for the sanctions regime imposed on Haiti to be lifted following the return of President Aristide.
 The Council, in resolution 940 (1994), also affirmed that it would review the measures imposed pursuant to resolutions 841 (1993) and 917 (1994), with a view to lifting them in their entirety, immediately following the return to Haiti of President Aristide.
 In accordance with those provisions, we are today proceeding, by virtue of resolution 944 (1994), to lift the trade and financial embargo on Haiti, as well as the ban on air and marine traffic, upon the return of President Aristide.
 None the less, the international community will remain alert to the course of events in Haiti, to be reported on, in accordance with resolutions 917 (1994) and 940 (1994), by the Secretary-General and the countries taking part in the multinational force.
 The return of President Aristide, long awaited by the Haitian people and the international community, will signal the restoration of constitutional legitimacy, but that is just a point of departure.
 We hope that MICIVIH will soon be fully redeployed.
 We know that the Secretaries-General of both organizations are already working to that end.
 The Parliament began its deliberations yesterday.
 The restoration of the Haitian legislative body is in itself a positive development.
 The consolidation of democracy will be an ongoing task, riddled with risks and problems.
 I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.
 The meeting rose at 7.05 p.m.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
 Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II), document S/1994/1069.
 Members of the Council also have before them document S/1994/1110, which contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior consultations.
 It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution (S/1994/1110) to the vote.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): There were 15 votes in favour.
 The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as resolution 945 (1994).
 Mr. de Moura (Angola) (interpretation from French): I am asked to express myself in an official language of the United Nations.
 The Council has once again extended the mandate of the United Nations Verification Mission in Angola (UNAVEM II).
 We shall shortly witness the further efforts of the Council, perhaps with a view to proceeding from UNAVEM II to UNAVEM III by increasing the number of United Nations personnel in Angola.
 There may perhaps be some outstanding issues on the Lusaka agenda, but if political will prevails on both sides, particularly on the UNITA side, I think we shall soon be successful.
 successfully completed and that we may shortly proceed to implementation, which will require all of us, and the international community in particular, to provide the material support, human resources and all that is necessary to ensure that lasting peace is restored to Angola.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): There are no further speakers.
 The meeting rose at 7.20 p.m.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
 Members of the Council have before them the report by the Secretary-General concerning the situation in Somalia, document S/1994/1068.
 Members of the Council also have before them document S/1994/1119, which contains the text of a draft resolution submitted by Rwanda and Spain.
 France, Nigeria, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have joined those sponsors of the draft resolution.
 It is my understanding that the Council is ready to vote on the draft resolution before it.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): The result of the voting is as follows: 14 votes in favour, none against, and 1 abstention.
 The draft resolution has been adopted as resolution 946 (1994).
 We still support that schedule, even if we are ready to participate in a debate on this subject.
 It would be a serious decision for the Security Council to terminate a force prematurely.
 Thus, this debate must be based on precise information and recommendations of the Secretary-General, which he is to include in the report that he intends to submit to the Council on 15 October next.
 The time has truly come to convene the conference that has been postponed so often.
 Mr. Al-Sameen (Oman) (interpretation from Arabic): I should like, at the outset, to thank the Secretary-General through you for his report on the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II).
 My delegation has studied this report carefully and with great interest.
 There is no doubt that the Secretary-General's report reflects the regrettable situation that now prevails in Somalia despite the great international efforts that have been deployed to help the brotherly Somali people.
 My delegation has observed that UNOSOM II has redeployed its personnel in such a way that it has now become concentrated in three locations only.
 It is regrettable that this redeployment is with the aim of enabling the forces to protect themselves as a result of the fact that UNOSOM II units have been subjected to attacks by the armed militias in Somalia.
 On previous occasions, my country's delegation has voiced its belief that the resolution of the Somali problem is a responsibility borne by the Somalis themselves.
 Once again, we underline our conviction that the resolution of the Somali problem is the responsibility of the Somalis themselves.
 Unfortunately, they have not responded positively or shown any desire, so far, to solve the problems arising from their differences.
 Once again we urge the Somali leaderships to assume their responsibilities and work toward ending their differences.
 We urge them to achieve national reconciliation and go on to apply and implement the agreements regarding their problem into which they have entered.
 Our reading of the resolution just adopted shows, as we felt in the consultations that preceded its drafting, that the Security Council's patience is running thin and that next October will mark a decisive stage in the United Nations Operation in Somalia.
 Each of the Secretary-General's reports - in July, in August and again in September - has said the security situation is getting worse.
 The Secretary-General's latest report continues the grim litany of past losses and future danger.
 Concern has now reached such proportions that the UNOSOM Force Commander has been compelled to withdraw from many areas in Somalia, and by next month all troops will be concentrated in only three cities.
 The sole legacy of the past four months is a pile of broken promises.
 When the Council last considered the UNOSOM mandate, in May, we were waiting for the Somali factions to finally hold a national reconciliation preparatory conference that had already been postponed four times.
 In August, and again in September, we were told a separate Hawiye clan conference was a necessary precursor to national reconciliation and that we had to wait for that.
 Today we learned that that conference also did not meet as scheduled and will not meet in the future.
 Yet some still say the Council should delay action and that another Conference, some time in October, will bring political reconciliation.
 Looking at the trail of broken promises left by the Somali factions, my Government will not listen to another assurance of just one more month, just one more conference.
 UNOSOM is draining away scarce human and financial resources that would be better used by the international community elsewhere.
 While UNOSOM has accomplished a great deal, saving hundreds of thousands of Somalis from starvation, its further continuation cannot be justified.
 In the face of Somali intransigence and unwillingness to reach political agreement, UNOSOM cannot continue to maintain 15,000 troops in Somalia and spend over $2.5 million a day.
 My Government believes the gravity of the situation, spelled out in the Secretary-General's own report, does not countenance such delay.
 It is our firm hope and expectation that the Secretary-General will utilize the coming days to complete planning for the withdrawal and in his next report provide the Council with a realistic proposal for an orderly and expeditious withdrawal.
 We see no reason why such a report cannot be presented in the near future to permit the Council to consider and act on withdrawal well before the end of today's one-month extension.
 There should be no doubt about my Government's position, however.
 The Council's principal concern from now on must be the safe withdrawal of UNOSOM's forces.
 But time is running short.
 The threat to United Nations peace-keepers increases by the day. Another was shot only yesterday.
 Mr. Bakuramutsa (Rwanda) (interpretation from French): It is true that the question of Somalia primarily concerns the Somalis themselves.
 But it is equally true that it is an African question, and more specifically a question for the subregion known as the Horn of Africa.
 No resolution could properly address this question without taking into account these three elements: the Somali parties involved in the situation, the surrounding countries and Africa as a whole.
 The failure of previous resolutions should not make us stop looking for more appropriate solutions than those adopted so far.
 My delegation would like to ask the Security Council and the Secretary-General to avoid another Rwanda, from which no one has yet recovered.
 In voting for the draft resolution, my delegation therefore wished to encourage a search for solutions to the Somali situation involving African regional and subregional organizations in the implementation of the four action points contained in the resolution.
 My delegation thanks the Secretary-General for his report on the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II), dated 17 September 1994.
 We are awaiting the second part of the report, which is to contain the Secretary-General's assessment of the prospects of national reconciliation and recommendations for the future of the United Nations operation in Somalia.
 This second part will include the results of the recent visit to Somalia of the Under-Secretary General for Peace-keeping Operations, Mr. Kofi Annan, whose initial impressions we heard yesterday with interest at the informal meeting with the troop-contributing countries to the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II).
 This sombre scenario indicates that the activities of the militias are continuing and expanding, independent of any agreement entered into by the heads of the Somali factions.
 This situation is restricting and indeed endangering the freedom of movement and the very effectiveness of UNOSOM II and the humanitarian agencies in discharging their mandates.
 Indeed, the commander of the force has been compelled to begin preparations for reducing the number of personnel and concentrating them in three areas: Mogadishu, Baidoa and Kismayu.
 This is symptomatic of the current uncertainty affecting a continued United Nations presence in Somalia, with unavoidably adverse consequences on the important humanitarian assistance work the international community is carrying out in this country.
 In accordance with resolution 946 (1994), just adopted by the Council, and in conformity with the Secretary-General's recommendations, the mandate of UNOSOM II has been extended for a one-month period, until 31 October 1994, while we await the Secretary-General's complete assessment and recommendations.
 This resolution emphasizes the importance the Council attaches to the need for a detailed analysis of UNOSOM II's mandate and very future.
 As my delegation firmly believes, this will provide the essential elements for the adoption of the most realistic decision, without entirely abandoning the Somali people to their fate.
 The contents of the resolution itself send a clear message to the Somali factions that the international community's patience is coming to an end.
 Today more than ever, the Somali parties must show their sincere interest in achieving national reconciliation and peace in their country, enabling the Somali people to regain hope and to take charge of their own fate.
 I now resume my functions as President of the Council.
 There are no further speakers inscribed on my list.
 The meeting rose at 5.35 p.m.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 At the invitation of the President, Mr. Sacirbey (Bosnia and Herzegovina) took a place at the Council table.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
 It notes that normal life has not been fully restored to Sarajevo, as called for in its resolution 900 (1994).
 "It condemns in particular the deliberate attack on 22 September 1994 on UNPROFOR troops in Sarajevo, just one of a number of attacks which clearly suggest a deliberate pattern.
 The Council also notes with alarm, and condemns without reservation, the reported statements of the Bosnian Serb leadership that the Bosnian Serb party would target UNPROFOR activities in retaliation for the passage of a Council resolution tightening sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs.
 "The Council fully supports UNPROFOR's efforts to assure compliance with measures designed by the international community to improve conditions in Sarajevo. It advises both parties, and in particular the Bosnian Serbs, to comply with those measures.
 "The Council strongly condemns any provocative actions in Sarajevo and elsewhere in Bosnia and Herzegovina by whomsoever committed and demands immediate cessation of such actions.
 This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/1994/57.
 The meeting rose at 5.40 p.m.
 The meeting was called to order at 5.50 p.m.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 At the invitation of the President, Mr. Sacirbey (Bosnia and Herzegovina) and Mr. Nobilo (Croatia) took places at the Council table.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I have also received a request dated 30 September 1994 from His Excellency Mr. Vladislav Jovanovic, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to address the Council.
 Once again, our willingness to compromise and cooperate with the Contact Group is being misappropriated and manipulated through deliberate misinformation.
 More to the point, commitments to address the urgent situations in Sarajevo, Srebrenica and other besieged areas are being marginalized. These matters deserve to be dealt with urgently in the context of the draft resolution before us in a clear and direct fashion.
 With respect to the renewal of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) mandate and, in particular, the draft resolution before us, we must make two clear reflections.
 First, every Security Council resolution mandating UNPROFOR has been adopted in the context of the unadulterated commitment of the Council to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 Similarly, attempts to redefine the UNPROFOR mandate to reflect a fear or lack of will to exercise the Security Council's directives must not be accepted as a de facto basis for continuing the mandate.
 Instead, additional resources should be provided or the mandate itself must be fully terminated.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): The next speaker is the representative of Croatia, on whom I now call.
 Mr. Nobilo (Croatia): Mr. President, at the beginning allow me to extend to you my congratulations on your able presidency of this body for this month.
 Similarly, we welcome the Security Council's support for the mutual recognition between the successor States of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia within their internationally recognized borders.
 My Government views that as the essential next step in the solution-seeking process in the region.
 One aspect of a positive linkage involves the eventual lifting of the arms embargo against the federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 Most importantly, the situation in the occupied territories in Croatia must be linked to the negotiating process pursued by the Contact Group in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 Mutual recognition will secure the best possible alternative for the protection of minority rights in respect of the Serbian minority in Croatia and the Croat minority in Serbia and Montenegro - reciprocity.
 Finally, I must express discontent and regret that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) has been given the right to address the Council.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the representative of Croatia for the kind words he addressed to me.
 Mr. Jovanovic: The Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia shares the view of the Secretary-General contained in his report in document S/1994/1067 of 17 September 1994 that the mandate of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) should be renewed for a further period of six months.
 In that context, the clear position of the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was reaffirmed in the letter by His Excellency Mr. Radoje Kontic, Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, addressed to the Secretary-General on 9 September 1994 (S/1994/1045).
 The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia supports the Vance Plan and is interested in having it fully respected and implemented by all.
 UNPROFOR's presence in the protected areas has been of vital importance for the protection of the Serbian civilian population of Krajina, pending the negotiated settlement among the parties to the conflict which was indeed the main goal of the Plan.
 It has been precisely UNPROFOR that has ensured the consistent implementation of the Vance Plan, enabled the fragile peace to be maintained and prevented further confrontation of the parties to the conflict.
 The extension of UNPROFOR's mandate and the protection of the Serbian population cannot be used by one side as an instrument for exerting political pressure in the negotiating process.
 The difficulties in implementing the mandate of UNPROFOR and the Vance Plan should not serve as a pretext for questioning its validity.
 As stated in the Secretary-General's reports on UNPROFOR, the Croatian Government has repeatedly - throughout the implementation of UNPROFOR's mandate - violated Security Council resolutions, provisions of the Vance Plan and other relevant documents of the United Nations regarding the protected areas.
 The recent agreement on the establishment of six working groups on economic issues and the resumption of negotiations on the opening of the Belgrade-Zagreb highway give ground for some hope.
 However, the Republic of Croatia has persistently attempted to politicize the current negotiating process and has, contrary to the Vance Plan, opened the question of a final political settlement.
 The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is convinced, however, that a three-phase policy is the only way to achieve peace.
 Building on the results of the cease-fire, negotiations should be speedily resumed on confidence-building measures and the re-establishment of economic relations and infrastructure, which would enable a modus vivendi in Krajina to be established and the Vance Plan to be realized.
 When this has been carried out in full, conditions could be attained for the negotiation of the final political settlement.
 The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia fully supports the Secretary-General's assessment that, in the absence of an overall political settlement acceptable to all of the parties, UNPROFOR's current presence and activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina remain invaluable.
 UNPROFOR has indeed played a major role in supporting humanitarian activities, facilitating local cease-fires and disengagements, and fostering reconciliation and cooperation between communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 Any decision that might be geared towards lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims would have disastrous effects.
 It not only would contribute directly to the rapid escalation, and even the spread, of the civil war, but would clearly instigate the departure of the majority of the UNPROFOR troop-contributing nations, with incalculable effects.
 In order to convince the Bosnian Serbs to accept the logic of peace, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has closed the border except to foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing for humanitarian needs and has severed political and economic ties with the Bosnian Serbs.
 The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is convinced, however, that a lasting and just solution to the conflict and crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina can be reached only by political means, taking into account the vital interests and full equality of all three peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 We refer in particular to the third and fifth preambular paragraphs and to operative paragraphs 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13 and 14 of the draft resolution.
 Various provisions of the draft resolution reflect exclusively, in a very one-sided manner, the position of the Croatian side and depart from the spirit and letter of the Vance Plan as the only internationally agreed document on the resolution of the crisis in the United Nations protected areas.
 In so doing, the draft resolution can lead down a dangerous path which could unravel the positive elements that have been achieved so far through the cease-fire and negotiations for the re-establishment of economic links.
 For its part, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, despite the remaining sanctions, will strive to facilitate the UNPROFOR peace mission in the former Yugoslavia and will continue to make the utmost efforts in the attainment of a just and lasting political settlement.
 We are convinced, however, that an urgent and unconditional lifting of all sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is the most effective way of contributing to the reinstatement of peace in the region.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to vote on draft resolution S/1994/1120, as orally revised in its provisional form.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): There were 15 votes in favour.
 The draft resolution, as orally revised in its provisional form, has been adopted unanimously as resolution 947 (1994).
 Mr. Mim\x{5daa} (France) (interpretation from French): It is entirely right that the resolution we have just adopted should emphasize the essential role played by the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslavia and pay tribute to the performance of those serving in that Force.
 The Force has been the target of some criticism - completely unwarranted, in the eyes of my delegation - which is especially paradoxical in that it has been voiced by those whose protection it provides or by some whose support for the cause they defend is usually purely verbal.
 In the worst-case scenario, there would be generalized conflict throughout the Balkans.
 But UNPROFOR has neither the mandate nor the military means to impose peace.
 Nevertheless, it has performed its task admirably, averting the resumption of hostilities, providing protection for humanitarian assistance and preventing the extension of the conflict beyond the borders of the former Yugoslavia.
 In so doing, it has paid a heavy toll, for 118 Blue Helmets have died since the creation of the Force.
 My delegation would like once again to pay them a solemn tribute.
 Everyone is aware that we have undoubtedly reached a turning point in the history of the Force.
 The next stage, therefore, will be crucial and UNPROFOR will have a central role to play in it.
 It will have to reassure those parties that, although in a position of military inferiority, have made the courageous choice to negotiate. It will have to prove to them that they were right to place their trust in the international community.
 This means that UNPROFOR will have to strive to ensure strict implementation of the Council's decisions, particularly those concerning safe areas. This might imply the use of force, if necessary, especially to ensure respect for the exclusion zones.
 The French Government therefore hopes that very explicit instructions along those lines will be issued to the leaders of the Force.
 By demonstrating its determination, the international community will prevail over those who would gamble on chaos.
 Mr. Cardenas (Argentina) (interpretation from Spanish): We feel that the noble work of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslavia has had a positive influence on stability in the region and that it therefore deserves our praise.
 The presence of that Force, to which Argentina has contributed a significant contingent, clearly demonstrates that the international community still hopes that peace and stability can be established in the area.
 Similarly, so that they may carry out their duties better, the long-sought agreement on their status must be concluded.
 Pressure - whether in the form of preconditions, blockades or other policies - will not help resolve the differences or improve the situation.
 In the present situation, Argentina considers it important to extend UNPROFOR's mandate for six months.
 Then the Security Council will meet again to evaluate progress in the execution of the mandate, if events on the ground so require.
 At the same time, we acknowledge that peace-keeping operations are a tool in the service of political negotiations and should in no way be understood to constitute lasting solutions.
 This is frankly discouraging, but we must not minimize the progress recently made towards peace, particularly the most important achievement which the maintenance of the current cease-fire represents for the patient inhabitants of that country.
 We are concerned at the stalemate in Croatia and at the continuing bloodshed and defiance of this Council's resolutions in Bosnia.
 All too much remains to be done and the improvements that have been achieved remain fragile and incomplete.
 We pay a tribute to the efforts of the Secretary-General's Special Representative, his Force Commanders and the men and women of UNPROFOR who, often at great personal risk, have made this possible.
 They deserve the respect and cooperation of all concerned.
 It is therefore only right that, in deciding to extend UNPROFOR's mandate for a further six months, the Council has called for the necessary arrangements, such as status-of-forces agreements, to be finalized without further delay.
 We also welcome the continuing cooperation between UNPROFOR and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
 UNPROFOR's freedom of movement and safety must be fully respected by all.
 My Government is one of the largest contributors of troops to UNPROFOR.
 We also play a major role in NATO's activities in support of UNPROFOR, in the Sarajevo airlift and in the international aid effort.
 We fully support the continuation of UNPROFOR's presence.
 In his report, the Secretary-General rightly drew attention to the uncertainties which have surrounded UNPROFOR's future.
 My Foreign Secretary has already welcomed the acceptance by the Bosnian Government of the fact that now is not the time to lift the arms embargo, thereby allowing UNPROFOR's work to continue.
 We must seize this opportunity and use the next six months to press ahead with efforts to achieve a just and lasting settlement.
 We must also help UNPROFOR consolidate what they have achieved so far, for example by looking at ways to promote the demilitarization of Sarajevo.
 My Government will continue to work with our partners in the Contact Group to achieve that peace.
 Mr. Sidorov (Russian Federation): The Russian Federation supported the resolution just adopted in the belief that the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) is playing an extremely important role in efforts to settle the conflicts in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.
 It cannot be denied that, without the presence of the Force, the situation there would be incomparably worse from both the political and the humanitarian viewpoints.
 This is true of virtually every aspect of the Force's activity, including its role in the "safe areas" in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 The role of UNPROFOR is no less important in the humanitarian sphere, which has become a significant factor in improving the living conditions of the population.
 We consider it important to increase pressure on all parties, using the full range of positive and negative incentives in order to promote a comprehensive peace settlement.
 Mr. Keating (New Zealand): New Zealand is pleased that the Security Council has decided to extend the mandate of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) for a further six months.
 UNPROFOR's mission is not an easy one.
 We believe that UNPROFOR is doing an outstanding job of alleviating suffering and maintaining a fragile peace.
 We thank the men and women serving the United Nations in the former Yugoslavia for performing this task in difficult and dangerous conditions.
 They deserve our support, and in this context we find it hard to understand that two States in whose territory UNPROFOR is deployed have yet to sign status-of-forces agreements with the United Nations in respect of the UNPROFOR deployment.
 This is long overdue and we believe that it is urgent to remedy this situation.
 But if UNPROFOR is to continue to be supported, the status quo cannot be continued.
 UNPROFOR'S ongoing operation must be complemented by efforts on other fronts, first with respect to Croatia.
 We know that the Government of Croatia is committed to the peaceful settlement of this problem, but it is rightly impatient at the slow progress on this front.
 It is unacceptable that a peace plan - a plan agreed some years ago and the subject of subsequent discussion - should still not be implemented.
 As we said at the time of the adoption of those resolutions, those measures needed to be followed up with further specific steps.
 We know that the use of force has to be carefully calibrated, but in our view its use has contributed to stability.
 Thirdly, the Council has made it clear on a number of occasions - most recently today - that the strangulation of Sarajevo must cease.
 Demilitarized lines of access to the city must be implemented.
 Fourthly, we believe that the progressive withdrawal of the Bosnian Serbs to positions that are consistent with the territorial settlement proposal should be seriously pursued.
 The Council has today adopted a presidential statement that begins to address some of these points, but in our view this is only a beginning.
 We think that it is quite reasonable for the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Government of Croatia to expect progress to have made been on all these fronts when the mandate of UNPROFOR next comes up for renewal.
 It is implicit or explicit in all the peace plans that have been put forward.
 Any State that equivocates on this matter runs the risk of having its bona fides in the peace process called into question.
 Mrs. Albright (United States of America): In the six months since the Council last authorized the extension of the mandate of the United Nation Protection Force (UNPROFOR) the situation in the States of the former Yugoslavia has changed significantly.
 In Bosnia, the most important development has been the Contact Group's presentation of its territorial proposal to the parties.
 The Contact Group has received consistent support from the Security Council, reaffirmed specifically in this resolution.
 We will continue to demand that the Bosnian Serbs accept the proposal, which, in our view, represents the best opportunity for a just and equitable settlement to this conflict.
 Just one week ago, with its adoption of a resolution tightening sanctions on the Bosnian Serbs, the Council reminded the Bosnian Serbs that their continuing obstinacy incurs substantial costs.
 In Croatia, a cease-fire is holding, but the promise of discussions between the parties has not produced the progress that had been hoped for.
 My Government strongly supports the basic precept, reflected in this resolution, that a settlement of the conflict in the Republic of Croatia - as in Bosnia - must be in conformity with its sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.
 This principle, which my Government considers an imperative, is reflected explicitly in this resolution.
 In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, economic difficulties have mounted, but conflict has blessedly not crossed its borders.
 UNPROFOR itself has been on the front line of all these developments.
 The largest peace-keeping operation in the history of the United Nations, UNPROFOR has played an essential role in the international community's efforts towards peace.
 In Bosnia, UNPROFOR has enabled humanitarian relief to continue flowing.
 When these measures have been violated, UNPROFOR has been willing to take more robust steps.
 My Government is concerned at the increasing number of violations of the terms of the exclusion zones, and committed to their strict enforcement.
 I am confident that, should strict enforcement continue to be necessary, UNPROFOR will work closely with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to ensure that the intent of the Council to protect the safe areas is carried out.
 In Croatia, UNPROFOR has been given an enormous task, much of which, as the Secretary-General has recently pointed out, it has been unable to carry out in the face of obstinacy.
 In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, UNPROFOR has played a valuable role in deterring conflict, with the full support of the Government and people of that country.
 In sum, an effective and vigorous UNPROFOR is vital to the success that we hope the political process will produce.
 Mr. Kovanda (Czech Republic): The Czech Republic considers the continuing operation of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as exceptionally important for the continuing political discussions on a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the region.
 The positive impact of the Protection Force has been different in each of these three countries.
 In Croatia, we have witnessed the stabilization of the situation since a cease-fire in the United Nations protected areas was signed last March.
 We have seen a separation of the belligerent parties.
 In the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, UNPROFOR's role is different - protecting humanitarian convoys, ensuring the security of Sarajevo airport, monitoring the no-fly zone, and showing the flag in safe areas.
 Yet UNPROFOR is not a panacea.
 The balance of the pluses and the minuses, however, is, in our view, overwhelmingly in its favour.
 The Czech Republic, therefore, did not hesitate to vote for an additional six-month extension of its mandate, and would have been even happier with a longer extension.
 Last week my delegation spoke at length about its views on the situation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including its views on those aspects that were covered in the presidential statement that you, Mr. President, read out during our earlier meeting.
 We see UNPROFOR's role in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as critical, even if it is a role that is sometimes criticized.
 There is, of course, only so much that a military peace-keeping force can attain.
 The central role of the political process is inescapable.
 In this respect, the Czech Republic views the future of relations between Zagreb and Belgrade as one of the most important keys to unlocking the gate to a peaceful settlement in the entire region.
 Zagreb and Belgrade had started to talk, and discussions were also initiated, within Croatia, between the Zagreb Government and the Croatian Serbs.
 The political process of implementing the Vance plan by reintegrating United Nations protected areas with the rest of Croatia is going nowhere.
 The process of freeing communications within Croatia - that is to say, road and railroad connections, water supply, telephone links or the Adria oil pipeline - is virtually frozen.
 Last week, with respect to Bosnia and Herzegovina's relationship with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), I made a point of this.
 This is equally valid for the relationship between Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
 In our resolution we stressed the importance we attach to mutual recognition, and my delegation wishes to underscore this particular point.
 One last point: both as a Security Council member and as an UNPROFOR troop-contributing country, with almost 1,000 men in Croatia, my delegation is particularly concerned by the continuing void in relations between the United Nations and Croatia.
 This, we feel, is strictly a matter of a political decision in Croatia, and, especially after our recent meeting with President Tudjman, we hope that such a political decision and the necessary political will to conclude such an agreement will become apparent.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): I shall now make a statement in my capacity as representative of Spain.
 For more than two and a half years now, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has made inestimable contributions to the channelling of humanitarian assistance, to the containment of hostilities and, most important, to making it possible to seek a negotiated solution to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.
 With regard to Croatia, we share the frustration and impatience of its people and its Government over the lack of concrete progress in the situation in the Krajinas, aside from the cease-fire's holding.
 It is regrettable that the Vance plan and numerous Security Council resolutions have still not been fully implemented.
 One third of Croatian territory is still not under the authority of the Government today, and scant progress has been made in the implementation of confidence-building measures.
 This has inevitable side-effects on the daily life of the civilian population in those zones, not to mention the situation of many refugees and displaced persons.
 As we have stated on other occasions, the so-called United Nations protected areas constitute an integral part of the Republic of Croatia, whose sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected.
 Clearly, the objective of the United Nations is not to preserve an unacceptable status quo.
 It is the parties who have the responsibility to resolve the problems still pending with the assistance and cooperation of UNPROFOR under the terms of its mandate and according to the means at its disposal.
 The statement condemns in particular the attacks perpetrated against UNPROFOR troops and warns against possible reprisals by the Bosnian Serb party.
 I wish to underline that resolution 947 (1994), which we have just adopted, broadens UNPROFOR's mandate with regard to, among other things, the civilian police (UNCIVPOL), with the aim of promoting the protection of people and minority groups throughout the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 Spain shares that view.
 We subscribe to the Secretary-General's opinion, reflected in the resolution we have just adopted, that that Republic, along with Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), must reach without delay an agreement with the United Nations on the status of UNPROFOR forces.
 Today NATO's decision, at the request of the Secretary-General, to extend the use of aerial power to the territory of Croatia, in defence of UNPROFOR, and to the safe area of Bihac, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, seems an equally wise decision.
 The Serbs, be they from Bosnia or from Croatia, should not forget that the terms of the decisions of the Security Council and NATO are still valid; nor should they harbour any doubts about the determination of the United Nations and NATO to apply those decisions when necessary.
 In conclusion, I should like to pay tribute once again to the men and women of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and reiterate our confidence in the Secretary-General, his Special Representative, Mr. Akashi, and the commanders of UNPROFOR, General de Lapresle and his colleagues.
 Instead, His Excellency Alija Izetbegovic has clearly demanded the immediate, de jure, lifting of the arms embargo against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with only deferred application for six months.
 His Excellency Alija Izetbegovic has also emphasized that if this compromise offer is not effectuated, then we will reassert our right, and demand, for an immediate, de facto as well as de jure, lifting, even if undertaken by unilateral means.
 The President (interpretation from Spanish): There are no further speakers.
 The meeting rose at 7.05 p.m.
 The meeting was called to order at 1.05 p.m.
 I am sure I speak for all members of the Security Council in expressing deep appreciation to Ambassador Ya\x{9391}z-Barnuevo for the great diplomatic skill and unfailing courtesy with which he conducted the Council's business last month.
 The President: The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on the agenda.
 It underlines the complete unacceptability of the implication therein that Iraq may withdraw cooperation from the United Nations Special Commission.
 The Security Council emphasizes the necessity of full implementation of all its relevant resolutions, including full cooperation by Iraq, without interference, with the United Nations Special Commission's vital mission.
 "The Security Council therefore requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) redoubles its vigilance and reports immediately any violation of the demilitarized zone established under resolution 687 (1991) or any potentially hostile action.
 It underlines Iraq's full responsibility to accept all the obligations contained in all its relevant resolutions and to comply fully therewith."
 This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/1994/58.
 The President: The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
 The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
 "The Security Council has considered the Secretary-General's progress report on the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) (S/1994/1133).
 It welcomes the Secretary-General's revised deployment schedule for UNAMIR which is intended to promote security in all sectors of the country and create conditions conducive to the return of refugees.
 It encourages UNAMIR to continue that assistance and asks the Secretary-General to provide it with detailed information on this programme.
 It deplores the continuing acts of intimidation and violence within the refugee camps which are designed to prevent the refugee population there from returning home.
 It welcomes the commitment of the Governments of Zaire, Tanzania and Burundi to help resolve the problems facing the refugees, and calls upon them to do all in their power to ensure the safety both of the refugees and of the international personnel providing humanitarian assistance to the refugees.
 The Security Council notes the important role human rights monitors and their speedy deployment will have in this context and notes also the importance of cooperation between them and UNAMIR.
 "The Security Council welcomes the assurance given to Council members by President Bizimungu of his Government's commitment to achieving national reconciliation and promoting respect for the fundamental rights of individuals.
 In this context it endorses the Secretary-General's call to the Government of Rwanda to maintain an open dialogue with all political interest groups in Rwanda in an effort to achieve genuine reconciliation between all elements of Rwandan society, within the frame of reference of the Arusha Peace Agreement.
 "The Security Council commends the assistance given by the international community, the UN agencies and non-governmental organizations in response to the crisis in Rwanda.
 It calls on them to maintain their support during the difficult transition period and to begin to redirect their support from relief to rehabilitation and reconstruction.
 "The Security Council agrees with the Secretary-General that developments in Rwanda strengthen the case for a broader approach to the question of national reconciliation and other key aspects of the crisis.
 This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/1994/59.
 The meeting rose at 10.55 a.m.
 The President: I should like to inform the Council that I have received letters from the representatives of Canada and Haiti, in which they request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 At the invitation of the President, Mr. Longchamp (Haiti) took a place at the Council table; Mrs. Fr\x{5db0}hette (Canada) took the place reserved for her at the side of the Council Chamber.
 The President: The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
 Members of the Council also have before them document S/1994/1163, which contains the text of a draft resolution submitted by Argentina, Canada, Djibouti, France, Pakistan, Spain, the United States of America and Venezuela.
 Mrs. Fr\x{5db0}hette (Canada): Mr. President, allow me first to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for the month of October.
 Let me also thank your predecessor, Ambassador Ya\x{9391}z-Barnuevo for his effective leadership during the month of September.
 Today, President Aristide returned to Haiti.
 This afternoon, in the presence of thousands of his fellow citizens and representatives from many countries, including my own Foreign Minister, President Aristide resumed office.
 We salute the courage of all those in Haiti who fought to bring democracy back to their country, and the memory of those, both well-known and unsung, who perished in the struggle.
 Their aspirations have prevailed.
 The commitment and the combined efforts of individuals, groups and international organizations have been key to attaining this outcome.
 As one of the group of Friends of Haiti, Canada shares with tremendous satisfaction the realization of our common objectives.
 The peaceful deployment of the multinational coalition under the authority of the United Nations has played a decisive role in establishing conditions which have allowed the return of President Aristide.
 We commend the coalition for its efforts.
 Canada supports a rapid transition from the multinational operation to the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) when a secure and stable climate has been established in Haiti.
 We reiterate our commitment to take part in UNMIH, which will help Haitians to consolidate peace and democracy and to build a stable society.
 We welcome the return of the joint United Nations/Organization of American States Civilian Mission, which also has an important role to play in this regard.
 The Haitian Parliament is sitting once again and democratic leaders are resuming their duties.
 Canada firmly supports the appeal of President Aristide for cooperation and reconciliation at a time when Haiti is once again embarking upon the road to democracy.
 Haiti will need quick and considerable support.
 Last week, a group of donors, including Canada, worked together to eliminate arrears in Haitian debt to international financial institutions.
 Canada intends to make a considerable contribution to the reconstruction efforts.
 No one denies the dangers that still exist, the challenges that lie ahead, or the set-backs that might be experienced as Haiti finds its way.
 However, let us at least for today focus on what has been achieved: President Aristide has returned, democracy is being restored.
 The President: I thank the representative of Canada for her kind words addressed to me.
 The next speaker is the representative of Haiti.
 I now call on him.
 Mr. Longchamp (Haiti) (interpretation from French): Just a few hours ago, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide returned to Haiti after three years of enforced exile in order to resume his duties and pursue the mandate entrusted to him by the Haitian people.
 This is a great day for Haiti because with peace restored, the people can devote itself to reconstruction and economic development.
 Finally, it is a great day for democracy, for which we all struggle, because this victory represents progress for democracy throughout the world.
 The return of President Aristide once again demonstrates that when consensus is reached, the international community has the means to have its decisions implemented.
 A first step has been successfully taken.
 Much remains to be done to establish that democracy once and for all.
 As you well know, democracy and development are related and there can be no true peace if the living conditions of the population are not improved.
 To conclude, let me once again, on behalf of the Haitian people and my Government, express heartfelt thanks to the international community, which has contributed so largely to the dawning of this day.
 The President: It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to vote on the draft resolution before it.
 Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 Mr. Sardenberg (Brazil): I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for the month of October.
 My delegation feels reassured by your experience and skill that we shall have fruitful results from our deliberations this month.
 Constitutional rule was trampled on by a junta, and appalling scenes of violence against human dignity became routine.
 We consistently supported the diplomatic efforts pursued by the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS) and promptly implemented the embargo against the de facto authorities aimed at the re-establishment of democracy in Haiti.
 Today we warmly welcome the return of President Aristide to Haiti.
 We are particularly honoured by the words that President Aristide expressed personally to our representative to the OAS in appreciation for Brazil's stance in the course of the process.
 Reservations were also expressed by Latin American countries non-members of the Security Council at the formal meeting when resolution 940 (1994) was adopted.
 The draft resolution before us today contains concepts that my delegation cannot support.
 To do so would be inconsistent with the position taken by my delegation in relation to resolution 940 (1994), particularly in view of our respect for the principle of non-intervention contained in the Constitution of Brazil.
 Brazil stands ready to contribute actively in this effort.
 The President: I thank the representative of Brazil for the kind words he addressed to me.
 Mr. Ayewah (Nigeria): Permit me to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of October.
 His peaceful return is due to the tremendous efforts of the United Nations, its Secretary-General, the regional organization and other Member States.
 We hope that the full and peaceful implementation of the Governors Island Agreement, freely entered into by the former military leaders and President Aristide, will now proceed expeditiously.
 This development gives my delegation the assurance that the prospects for peacefully resolving the Haitian crisis are better today than they would have been had forceful military intervention proceeded as planned.
 Indeed, when my delegation supported resolution 940 (1994) it was not our judgement that, as of that time, the status of the problem justified forceful military intervention.
 We hope that, with President Aristide's return, the processes of rehabilitation, reconstruction and, more important, national reconciliation will begin, with the support and encouragement of a determined people and the assistance of the international community.
 The President: I thank the representative of Nigeria for the kind words he addressed to me.
 We take this opportunity to congratulate the coalition of countries of the region, and other friends of Haiti, that have cooperated in the achievement of this objective.
 My delegation wishes peace and democracy to reign and become rooted in Haiti, and wishes the Haitians and their descendants to enjoy their benefits for a long time to come.
 I shall vote for this draft resolution, considering it as fostering the beginning of new development for Haiti.
 The President: I thank the representative of Rwanda for the kind words he addressed to me.
 I shall now put to the vote the draft resolution contained in document S/1994/1163.
 The President: The result of the voting is as follows: 14 votes in favour, none against and 1 abstention.
 The draft resolution has been adopted as resolution 948 (1994).
 Mrs. Albright (United States of America): Let me congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency.
 We look forward to a month of hard work led clearly and diplomatically.
 Today, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has returned to Haiti.
 With the return of Haiti's freely elected leader to rightful rule, the first essential step has been completed towards national renewal under democratic government.
 This Council can and should rightfully take satisfaction from this success.
 For three years, the United Nations and the Organization of American States have toiled to achieve this moment.
 These years have seen moments of hope, as with the signing of the Governors Island Agreement, and moments of infamy, as with assassinations in Haiti of Guy Malary, Georges Ismery and Fr. Jean-Marie Vincent.
 Today we must remember the many thousands of Haitians who lost their lives during the years of brutal dictatorship.
 Today, however, does not belong to the international community, not even to President Aristide.
 Today we must share their joy and celebrate the end of their oppression.
 To the people of Haiti we say: We are with you and we will help you.
 I must pay a special tribute to the personnel of the Multinational Force (MNF) in Haiti for their exemplary contribution in bringing Haiti to this day.
 These valiant women and men represent the finest traditions of the 30 nations from this region and other regions which are participating in this peaceful effort to bring democracy to Haiti.
 Today's triumph must not obscure tomorrow's tasks.
 The international community, and especially the United Nations, stand with the people of Haiti to assist their efforts at restoration, reconciliation and reconstruction.
 In some months, the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH), as authorized by this Council under resolution 940 (1994), will replace the MNF to continue the work already begun in Haiti.
 We look forward to that day and to a Haitian future of peace and democracy.
 The President: I thank the representative of the United States for her kind words addressed to me.
 Mr. Cardenas (Argentina) (interpretation from Spanish): At the outset, I wish to welcome your presidency, Sir, and to express thanks for the work done last month by the Spanish delegation, headed by Ambassador Ya\x{9391}z-Barnuevo.
 Allow me also to celebrate the presence in our midst of Ambassador Longchamp, this time with President Aristide back on Haitian soil.
 Nevertheless, we in this Council did not falter in our efforts.
 These peaceful goals prevailed, and this led to a rebirth of hope among a people that had suffered so much and yet through all of this adversity had borne its burden with the utmost dignity.
 Without the support of the members of the Council which made possible the adoption of resolution 940 (1994), the present situation would not have come about.
 To all of them, we offer our appreciation.
 It fuelled the hope of a people that today, along with its martyrs, is celebrating the rediscovery of freedom.
 We also welcome his clearly conciliatory attitude.
 Mr. Mim\x{5daa} (France) (interpretation from French): Mr. President, the French delegation would like to express to you its pleasure at seeing you leading the work of the Council for this month with your well-known skill.
 I am pleased that after these three long years Ambassador Longchamp is here with us today to share in this success.
 In this connection my delegation regrets that the Council was not able to hail this clear success of the international community with unanimity.
 Hope has thus been restored to the people of Haiti, along with their ability freely to choose their own future.
 I would reiterate that my country will contribute substantially to the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH), which we hope will take up its functions as quickly as possible.
 The President: I thank the representative of France for his kind words addressed to me.
 Mr. Ya\x{9391}z-Barnuevo (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish): I should like at the outset to express to you, Mr. President, the Spanish delegation's satisfaction at seeing you leading the Council's work with your accustomed ability and authority.
 Accordingly, my delegation extends heartfelt congratulations to the Permanent Representative of Haiti, Ambassador Longchamp of Haiti.
 Indeed, we can all feel great satisfaction at what has taken place today in Port-au-Prince.
 With that, there came to a temporary end a promising chapter in Haiti's history, one that had begun with the holding of open, democratic elections recognized as such by the United Nations and other international observers.
 Unfortunately, it began to seem that at each turn in Haiti's history a new threat loomed on its horizon.
 The situation in Haiti has not been critical only for that country's people, since, owing to the exceptional circumstances inherent in this case, the entire region has risked destabilization because of a humanitarian crisis that has led, at times, to massive displacements of population.
 Today, 15 months later, we can say that those efforts have been crowned with success.
 In the last few hours the Haitian people have recovered their legitimate institutions and the President they democratically elected three years ago.
 Within a few hours, most of the sanctions imposed by the Security Council will have been definitely lifted.
 Haiti's journey is just beginning.
 Today, the Haitian people, with the support and assistance of the international community, must now bend themselves to the task of consolidating democracy, of national reconciliation, of economic development and of social justice.
 All those endeavours form part of the letter and the spirit of resolution 948 (1994), which the Council has just adopted.
 The President: I thank the representative of Spain for his kind words addressed to me.
 Mr. Sidorov (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): I should like, first, on behalf of the delegation of the Russian Federation, to congratulate you, Sir, on assuming the presidency of the Security Council and to wish you success in your responsible work.
 Likewise, I express our gratitude to the Ambassador of Spain for his successful work as President of the Council during September.
 The Russian delegation would like to express its satisfaction over an important event in the life of the Haitian people - the return to Haiti of the country's legitimate President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
 This event marks the beginning of a new, promising stage in the achievement of a settlement for this long-suffering country, which we hope will now be able to overcome the legacy of military dictatorship and restore democratic institutions in a spirit of true national reconciliation.
 We also draw attention to the efforts of the Multinational Force in Haiti in the establishment of a secure and stable environment - a key factor for Haiti's return to normal life.
 We hope that the Multinational Force will carry out its mandate in accordance with Security Council resolution 940 (1994).
 We proceed on the basis that in due course the Council will have to analyse the situation in connection with the requirements of paragraph 8 of that resolution, a necessary condition for a decision by the Council to proceed to the second stage of the United Nations operation.
 Like other delegations in the Council, the Russian delegation intends, in this regard, to give special attention to the criteria for conducting peace-keeping operations - criteria that are becoming a regular feature of the Council's consideration of such problems.
 The President: I thank the representative of the Russian Federation for his kind words addressed to me.
 There are no further speakers.
 The President: I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Kuwait, in which he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 The President: The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
 Members of the Council have before them document S/1994/1164, which contains the text of a draft resolution submitted by Argentina, France, Oman, Rwanda, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America.
 In the third line of the eighth preambular paragraph, the word "underlining" should be underscored.
 Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 Mr. Ayewah (Nigeria): My delegation welcomes the current initiatives being undertaken by a number of States to address a perceived destabilization of the status quo that existed between Iraq and Kuwait prior to 6 October.
 That we are revisiting the question a week later is testimony to one desire of the international community: to maintain a hands-on policy on the situation in that region, especially given its potential for constituting a threat to international peace and security.
 My Government wishes to reiterate its belief that relations between States should be built on peaceful coexistence and mutual respect for one another's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
 The dispute has been the subject of numerous Council resolutions, all of which were aimed at resolving all implications of the problem, thus bringing a final solution to the matter.
 The obligations these resolutions imposed on all Member States, in particular Iraq, were mandatory and non-negotiable.
 Since becoming a member of the Security Council, my delegation has emphasized the obligation of Iraq fully to accept and implement all those resolutions.
 As a delegation, we had acknowledged the positive steps Iraq had taken to implement section C of resolution 687 (1991), as well as resolution 715 (1991) on the establishment of a mechanism for monitoring and verifying Iraq's armament industry.
 Only this week, the Council had received the report of its Special Commission, which confirmed that the system of monitoring and verification was provisionally operational.
 The events since 6 October 1994, however, have been a cause for concern to the international community.
 We believe also that Iraq has a responsibility to accept and acknowledge unambiguously the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait.
 We welcome the fact that this withdrawal and redeployment have commenced.
 We hope that the redeployment will be completed expeditiously so as to lessen tension in the region.
 In that light, my delegation will support the present draft resolution.
 Mr. Bakuramutsa (Rwanda) (interpretation from French): The movement of Iraqi troops towards the Kuwaiti border was a cause of concern to my country, especially since we still remember Iraq's invasion of Kuwait a little more than three years ago.
 Rwanda has just emerged from a war and other terrible atrocities, and my Government is particularly sensitive to what is happening and what could happen in Kuwait.
 My delegation agreed to join in sponsoring the draft resolution before the Council as a sign that it condemns Iraq's conduct, which continues to jeopardize peace and stability in Kuwait and throughout the region.
 My delegation hopes that additional efforts will be made to ensure that Iraq respects and implements those three provisions.
 Mr. Sidorov (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): The achievement of a lasting post-crisis settlement in the Persian Gulf region remains one of the priorities of Russian diplomacy.
 Another important element in our approach is the need for Iraq's full cooperation with the United Nations in order to overcome the consequences of the conflict and for the Council to respond properly to indications of a constructive attitude in the policies of the Government of Iraq.
 The dramatic turn of events in the region in recent days clearly showed the danger of the continuing failure to resolve the consequences of the 1990 Iraqi aggression against Kuwait.
 All together, we must seek ways to resolve the pending problems.
 During those contacts, Russia indicated that it favoured decisive action to prevent the escalation of tension and to turn the situation back in the direction of diplomatic efforts that could ultimately lead to the attainment of security and reliable stability in the region.
 As a result, Iraq has officially proclaimed, and as of today has virtually completed, the withdrawal of its troops to rear positions.
 It is vitally important that the joint Russian-Iraqi communiqu establishes Iraq's willingness positively to resolve the question of the recognition of the sovereignty and borders of Kuwait as determined pursuant to Security Council resolution 833 (1993).
 Therefore, the agreements reached open the way to a military dente between Iraq and Kuwait and help to advance an overall post-crisis settlement.
 We thought that was entirely justified since the Russian Foreign Minister had held, in Iraq and in other countries of the region, negotiations on problems which are now before the Council for consideration and which are partially reflected in the draft resolution submitted by the sponsors.
 At the same time, we note that the sponsors of the draft resolution did take into account some of our concerns and those of some other delegations and have agreed to some amendments that have made the text more balanced.
 For that reason the Russian delegation will support the draft resolution.
 Otherwise, we will only be forcing the disease to deeper levels and acting as mere spectators to its recurrence, postponing the advent of security and reliable stability in the region.
 The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as resolution 949 (1994).
 Mrs. Albright (United States of America): We are all familiar with Santayana's warning that those who forget the past are doomed to relive it.
 Beginning last week, Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council issued a bellicose statement threatening to end cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission and accusing Kuwait and the members of the United Nations Security Council of seeking to "kill as many Iraqis as possible".
 Simultaneously, Iraqi Republican Guard Units, including many of the same units used in 1990, began moving towards the Kuwaiti border.
 As in 1990, ammunition, communications and logistic support were all an integral part of this last mobilization.
 The Iraqi deployment of troops to Kuwait's border is a blatant attempt by Iraq to bully the United Nations Security Council into negotiating on its terms the lifting of oil-export sanctions.
 Such a provocative and foolish act was not necessary.
 Had Saddam Hussein done what we all know needs to be done -complied with all Council resolutions and proven Iraq's "peaceful intentions" - that easing of sanctions would have occurred in its own proper time.
 By this action, however, Iraq has set back its own cause.
 Can anyone seriously suggest that this act characterizes a nation intent on showing its peaceful intentions? Is there anyone who would subscribe to these Iraqi terms for gaining its re-entry into the community of responsible nations?
 The extreme irony is that some have attributed this action to Iraqi impatience with its population's suffering and a desire to break out of the stranglehold sanctions have imposed.
 Yet Iraqi authorities have enough money to maintain one of the largest armies and enough money to pay for military operations, whether to suppress the Marsh Arabs or to threaten Kuwait.
 Iraqi troops have begun to redeploy, albeit ambiguously, in a manner very similar to the duplicitous approach Iraq has taken in its diplomatic responses to the United Nations over the past four years.
 While claiming that Iraqi troops have withdrawn completely, in fact one division of Republican Guards has pulled back to Nasariyah, only an hour from the Kuwaiti border.
 Yet again, Iraq seems to have learned nothing and forgotten everything.
 Yet again, Saddam Hussein seeks to test this Chamber's resolve to deal with the threat to Kuwait.
 It is for these reasons that this resolution we have adopted today is so critical.
 The message in this resolution is clear.
 Iraq must withdraw all military units deployed to the south to their original positions.
 It must not take any action to enhance its military capabilities in southern Iraq.
 Iraq must never again use its military to threaten its neighbours or the United Nations operations in Iraq.
 Because the Government of Iraq is not credible, it must be judged by what it verifiably does, not by what it says.
 We cannot allow threats of unprovoked aggression to burgeon into the reality of renewed aggression.
 Iraq's record under Saddam Hussein's leadership is one littered with broken commitments.
 Had we accepted Saddam's word at any time that he would meet the obligations which have been imposed upon him and thereby let down our guard, we might be having a different kind of discussion here today, perhaps one involving how to reverse a second Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.
 Whatever his motive, whatever his objective, whatever his claim, it is only international political and military reaction that have stopped this hostile action dead in its tracks.
 Yet, over the past three years it has consistently refused to utter the name "Kuwait", instead continually referring to Kuwait as Iraq's nineteenth province.
 The events of the last week should leave no doubt that Iraqi promises have no value.
 That is why Iraq's recent statement about its readiness to recognize Kuwaiti sovereignty and borders leaves us unconvinced.
 For it to have any value, this statement must be followed by unambiguous action.
 Iraq must recognize Kuwait's sovereignty, territorial integrity and borders in the same manner it purported to annex Kuwait: with a statement ratified by the Revolutionary Command Council and by the Iraqi Parliament, published in the Official Gazette and communicated formally to the Security Council.
 Let us be clear about the facts: Iraqi spokesmen are engaged in a concerted effort to define truth as lies and lies as truth.
 They will not succeed.
 If Iraq's goal is to gain the lifting of sanctions, it can do so by complying with the resolutions of the Security Council.
 Moreover, those in Baghdad believe our vigilance in the south means that we will ignore Iraqi military moves in the north, they are dead wrong.
 In closing, let me assure this Council that pursuant to the resolutions of this Council and Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, my Government will take all appropriate action if Iraq fails to comply with the demands of this resolution.
 Mr. Mim\x{5daa} (France) (interpretation from French): The deployment of Iraqi troops towards the Kuwaiti border was a deplorable development to which it was proper for the Security Council to react as it did.
 We must have Iraq fully withdraw the forces it deployed in recent days in the direction of the Kuwaiti border.
 In addition, we must insist that Iraq abstain in the future from undertaking similar actions.
 I emphasize in particular the information reaching us regarding the declared intention of the Iraqi authorities to undertake to respect the political independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the State of Kuwait.
 This would constitute considerable progress in the right direction.
 I also wish to thank Ambassador Juan Antonio Ya\x{9391}z-Barnuevo for the careful, methodical and very effective way he handled the Council's business in the month of September.
 A small country is bound to be nervous when a powerful neighbour starts moving troops for no apparent reason towards its borders.
 My country has in living memory experienced the shadow of precisely such troop movements, manoeuvres, and declarations doubting its international legitimacy.
 To this day, historians argue whether an entirely different course of European history might not have ensued if the international community had demonstrated a stiffer resolve in 1938, for example.
 There is an entire booklet of resolutions that this body passed in the aftermath of the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait.
 In 1990, the international community rallied in defence of this small, vastly outgunned Member, and threw the aggressor out.
 My country is proud to have made its own modest contribution to that effort.
 This Council has done a lot to reduce the menace that Iraq poses to Kuwait, but Iraq has by its recent actions demonstrated that it may still be looking for some windows.
 The resolute stance of the international community, including the rapid response of United States and allied troops and this Council's own unequivocal presidential statement of exactly a week ago, have led to a withdrawal of the menacing Iraqi troops.
 Whether this withdrawal has been partial or total is a matter of debate, but our resolution, among other things, leaves no doubt that a total withdrawal has to be effected and similar troop movements may not recur.
 We welcome Foreign Minister Kozyrev's visit to the area and are looking forward to his impending visit to New York.
 We always prefer diplomacy to sabre-rattling and, in truth, Iraq's reported recent statements to Minister Kozyrev would have been much more welcome if loud sabre-rattling had not preceded them.
 "to practise tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours".
 The President: I thank the representative of the Czech Republic for the kind words he addressed to me.
 Mr. Al-Khussaiby (Oman): At the outset I wish to congratulate you, Sir, on assuming the presidency of the Council for this month.
 We are confident that with your wisdom and vast experience you will lead our work successfully.
 My delegation assures you of our fullest cooperation at all times.
 Our understanding in the Sultanate of Oman of resolution 949 (1994) is that it addresses the urgent situation in the region as a result of the latest Iraqi military action. It aims at preventing a repeat of such action.
 Oman believes a distinction has to be drawn between earlier Security Council resolutions and today's resolution.
 While welcoming the statement made by the Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation regarding Iraq's readiness to recognize Kuwait and the border agreement between the two countries, in accordance with resolution 833 (1993), we call upon our brothers in Iraq to translate such readiness into actual implementation.
 Such a step, in our opinion, will contribute towards strengthening peace and stability in the region and serve the interests of the brotherly people of Iraq.
 My country has repeatedly voiced through this respected forum its understanding of the plight of the Iraqi people as a result of continued economic sanctions imposed on their country.
 None the less, the recent action taken by Iraq to deploy its forces on the southern frontier along the border with Kuwait brought fear and concern about the peace and stability of the region, all of which weakened our endeavours and efforts.
 The President: I thank the representative of Oman for the kind words he addressed to me.
 Mr. Ya\x{9391}z-Barnuevo (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish): The recent deployment of a large number of Iraqi troops towards the border with Kuwait caused serious concern to the Spanish Government.
 For some days the world lived under the terrible threat that had led to the Gulf War in 1990.
 So the Security Council reacted clearly and swiftly in a presidential statement on 8 October, expressing the Council's grave concern over the troop movements and reaffirming Iraq's responsibility to comply with its obligations contained in the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.
 I would also like to recall that on 11 October the European Union issued a statement urging Iraq immediately to withdraw its troops from the border region, to refrain from confrontation and to cooperate fully in the implementation of the Council's resolutions.
 The Iraqi troop movements and the threat they implied forced the States in the region, with support from other States, to react immediately through preventive and defensive deployment to protect Kuwait, to whose sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity the Security Council is committed.
 In that connection, I should like to put on record the broad logistical support offered by the Spanish authorities, to the United States in particular, to facilitate this preventive deployment, which has been timely and useful in confronting the new Iraqi threat.
 The determination shown by the international community was decisive in quickly bringing about the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from their positions near the Kuwait border.
 We trust that the withdrawal of those forces to their bases will be completed as soon as possible, as the Iraqi Government has stated.
 Resolution 949 (1994), which we have just adopted, is an important step forward in preventing any repetition of similar situations which might entail a danger to Kuwait and other neighbours of Iraq.
 The Council's resolutions, including the one we have just adopted, are directed not against Iraq as a country, but, rather, against aggressive actions by the Iraqi regime in the recent past and threatening, bullying attitudes that are still being adopted today.
 Then, if the Government of Iraq truly desires to take effective steps to be reintegrated into the international community, it should clearly and unequivocally recognize Kuwait's sovereignty and independence as well as its borders, which are guaranteed under Security Council resolution 833 (1993).
 It should also collaborate fully and sincerely with the United Nations in fulfilling its other obligations under Security Council resolutions.
 Our thanks go also to the Ambassador of Spain for his work as President last month.
 For New Zealand - and, I think, for all the small countries of the world - the great importance of the United Nations is that it provides a framework for collective security.
 It provides hope for small countries that cannot defend themselves against aggression.
 Then, as now, New Zealand gave very strong support to Kuwait.
 We also supported the firm and determined response by the United Nations to evict Iraq's forces from Kuwait.
 In 1990 and 1991 the Security Council did what it had to do: it exercised its responsibilities under the Charter in the face of aggression and took the necessary measures to restore international peace and security.
 Last week it seemed possible that an attempt was being made to repeat that history.
 That deployment constituted a threat to regional peace and security, and the gravity of the threat is exacerbated not only by the events of 1990 but all the more by the fact that in the intervening period Iraq has stubbornly failed to recognize Kuwait's sovereignty and its borders.
 This kind of equivocation leaves doubt about Iraq's peaceful intentions.
 It raises fears that Iraq continues to harbour aggressive designs towards Kuwait.
 The situation is further compounded by the fact that Iraq also defies its legal obligations under the United Nations Charter by virtue of resolutions of this Council.
 It must not be repeated.
 Because Iraq has raised new doubts about its peaceful intentions, it was necessary and desirable that this resolution lay down some very clear markers about future troop deployments.
 We reject the argument that Iraq is free to deploy its forces however it wishes within its borders.
 Given its past aggressive wars, its equivocation about the sovereignty of its neighbour and its threatening moves last week, the Security Council has a responsibility to take certain protective measures, including requiring Iraq not to redeploy its forces to the south again.
 The President: I thank the representative of New Zealand for his kind words addressed to me.
 I believe that under your outstanding and skilful leadership, the Council will be successful in its work this month.
 I would also like to thank Ambassador Y\x{6459}ez-Barnuevo, who, as President of the Council in September, successfully guided us in our work last month.
 Kuwait being a State Member of the United Nations, we reaffirm that its sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected by the international community.
 It should be noted that our favourable vote on this resolution does not signify any change in our reservations regarding other relevant resolutions of the Council, including resolution 678 (1990).
 The President: I thank the representative of China for his kind words addressed to me.
 In either case it represents a threat to international peace and security and quite definitely a loss of credibility for Iraq.
 Information provided to the Council that has been repeated and updated suggests that now many of the troops redeployed by Iraq have begun to return to where they came from.
 This is no doubt due to the swift and decisive reaction of various States that hastened to lend their support once again to Kuwait.
 However, this information, which we appreciate, also indicates that a substantial number of Republican Guard units are still stationed in the southern part of Iraq in positions that are clearly threatening.
 The resolution that we have just adopted, of which my delegation is a sponsor, is designed to condemn Iraq for this and to require that it immediately complete the withdrawal of its troops and refrain in future from threatening or provoking Kuwait or any other countries in the region.
 There are, nevertheless, some indications that can be regarded as encouraging in that it seems that Iraq is ready to explicitly recognize the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait and the borders demarcated in resolution 833 (1993).
 We trust that very soon, and without any doubts or conditions, this will be confirmed through an explicit and unequivocal statement and other official actions by the Iraqi Government pursuant to its constitutional norms.
 In this way, one of Iraq's main obligations pursuant to resolutions adopted by the Security Council will have been complied with.
 The sooner this happens, the readier the international community will be to consider lifting the sanctions imposed on Iraq following its aggression against Kuwait in 1990.
 Mr. Marker (Pakistan): It is a source of great pleasure for my delegation to see you, Mr. President, once again at the helm of the affairs of the Security Council.
 Although the situation in Iraq has been under continuous review by the Security Council, it has been some time since the Council actually adopted a resolution relating to Iraq.
 We regret the recent events and the threatening Iraqi troop movements that compelled the Council members to resort to the decision that has been taken tonight.
 We hope that appropriate lessons will have been drawn from the latest crisis and that the objectives contained in this resolution will serve the larger purpose of maintaining peace and stability in the region.
 My delegation appreciates the invaluable role played by the United States in reversing what appeared to be a potentially dangerous situation.
 Pakistan enjoys brotherly relations both with Kuwait and with Iraq.
 The President: I thank the representative of Pakistan for his kind words addressed to me.
 Mr. Olhaye (Djibouti): At the outset I congratulate you, Sir, most warmly on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the current month.
 We are confident of your abilities and that the Council is in good hands.
 We also wish to express deep gratitude to Ambassador Ya\x{9391}z-Barnuevo for successfully and capably guiding the work of the Council last month.
 There is no doubt that my country did not hesitate to condemn these unjustified threats and intimidation against the people of Kuwait and against Kuwait's sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence.
 In our view, it had all the manifestations of a material breach of the main Security Council resolutions on this subject - in particular, resolutions 687 (1991) and 833 (1993).
 We demand that Iraq immediately complete its withdrawal of all military units recently deployed in the direction of the border with Kuwait.
 From now on, we believe, there is only one avenue available to Iraq - namely, that of seeking peace and learning to live peacefully with its smaller and weaker neighbour, the Kuwaiti nation.
 How that is to be achieved depends solely on Iraq, which must demonstrate peaceful intentions in concrete fashion and unequivocally to the international community.
 We believe that Iraq could do so, but it must have the necessary willingness and resolve.
 That is all it takes.
 The President: I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the United Kingdom.
 My Government is delighted that the Security Council adopted this resolution yesterday, thus underlining the determination of the Council to take firm and decisive action to prevent a recurrence of the events of 1990 and 1991.
 Fortunately the prompt action by the Council, through its statement of 8 October, made it clear to Saddam Hussein that the Council's resolve had not weakened, and helped to prevent another attempt by Iraq to threaten and browbeat its small neighbour and the international community.
 That statement and this resolution represent a classic example of preventive diplomacy.
 Once again Iraq has resorted to threatening its neighbours.
 My Government, along with the United States, France and other members of the coalition, responded immediately to Kuwait's request for assistance.
 This was followed by a doubling of the number of Royal Air Force Tornado aircraft in the Gulf and the dispatch of the spearhead battalion and of a further Royal Navy destroyer.
 That is why we have also insisted that the level of Iraqi forces in southern Iraq be kept where it was prior to the recent deployments.
 "from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state".
 Four years ago similar Iraqi troop movements led to the invasion of Kuwait.
 Let us be clear: this action was a threat to Kuwait and represented a breach of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.
 We note the apparent Iraqi "readiness" to recognize Kuwait and its borders on the basis of Security Council resolution 833 (1993).
 But the Security Council requires more than the recognition of Kuwait and its frontiers by Iraq.
 In the words of resolution 687 (1991), the Council needs "to be assured of Iraq's peaceful intentions".
 We also require full implementation of all the Council's relevant resolutions.
 In particular, Iraq must cooperate with the United Nations Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency in their continuing work aimed at securing full compliance with section C of resolution 687 (1991).
 It must remedy the appalling human rights situation throughout the country and cease the repression of its own citizens, as called for in Security Council resolution 688 (1991).
 It must cease any involvement in State-sponsored terrorism and it must cooperate with the International Committee of the Red Cross in accounting for the over 600 Kuwaiti and other nationals missing since the conflict.
 It is often suggested that recent Iraqi actions were intended to draw attention to the plight of the Iraqi people.
 I must say that I think this unlikely, given Saddam Hussein's record in heeding the concerns of his own people.
 Medical supplies have never been subject to United Nations sanctions and foodstuffs have been exempted since the adoption of resolution 687 (1991) in April 1991.
 Under the terms of resolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991), Iraq would have been permitted to sell up to $1.6 billion of oil over six months, in return for which it would have received nearly $1 billion worth of humanitarian supplies.
 More recently, Iraq blocked plans to flush the Iraq-Turkey oil pipeline, which would also have enabled more food and medicines to be imported.
 President Saddam Hussein has held the Iraqi people and the international community to ransom for too long.
 I resume my function as President of the Security Council.
 Nor can I fail to pay special tribute to your predecessor, Ambassador Barnuevo of Spain, or to congratulate him on his success in conducting the Security Council's work last month.
 To all members here, my friends, we express our gratitude for the devotion to peace and security and our thanks for the concern they have shown over Kuwait as a country and a people.
 Over the past few days, the Iraqi regime has engaged in a number of political and military activities and taken measures which, by any standards, violate the very basis of the cease-fire arranged by the Security Council in resolution 687 (1991).
 Those measures have created a climate of tension and unrest and have threatened regional peace and security.
 France, too, has participated in this effort to deter aggression and safeguard peace.
 The Foreign Ministers of the United States and the United Kingdom participated in part of that meeting pursuant to their countries' support for Kuwait, their desire to safeguard its security and stability.
 The resolution the Council has just adopted supports and reinforces that constructive tendency.
 I wish to thank in particular the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) for its important role in maintaining security and preventing any disturbance that may threaten security in the demilitarized zone for which it is responsible.
 UNIKOM's mandate has been strengthened by the paragraph referred to by the Council in its resolution of today in the President's statement of 8 October 1994, wherein the Council asked the Mission to redouble its vigilance and efforts in safeguarding the security of the region.
 Kuwait believes that if the Security Council resolutions adopted before the recent developments were moral and political deterrents to Iraq, today's resolution, with all the arrangements it contains, will prevent Iraq from repeating such actions.
 The President: I thank the representative of Kuwait for his kind words addressed to me.
 The meeting was called to order at 11.25 a.m.
 The President: I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Iraq, in which he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 The President: The Security Council will now continue its consideration of the item on its agenda.
 From the very outset we very firmly expressed our negative attitude to this.
 There were reports concerning upcoming manoeuvres in the Iraqi press as well, and there were reports that Iraq was not planning to attack Kuwait.
 That information was available to many States.
 Thus the events demanded an immediate reaction, but all the circumstances needed to be taken into account in determining the parameters of that reaction.
 We immediately expressed ourselves in favour of taking decisive measures to prevent an escalation of tensions and - I once again wish to emphasize - to return the situation to normal channels through political and diplomatic efforts.
 Moreover, in so doing, from the very outset - and I take note of this as a positive element - we acted in close and continuous contact with our partners, including the permanent and other members of the Security Council.
 Among those contacts I can note those on the highest level, including telephone conversations, between President Yeltsin and the President of the United States, Bill Clinton.
 In addition, the basic objectives were laid out: I shared my plans with my colleagues the heads of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of the United States, France, China and many other countries, and with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros-Ghali.
 Our position was clearly and firmly set out to the President of Iraq, Saddam Hussein.
 I note with satisfaction that all those three elements are reflected in resolution 949 (1994), adopted yesterday by the Security Council.
 Thanks to the amendments that were made, by the Russian delegation among others, the resolution was enriched.
 It is aimed at diplomatic methods and points the way to a return to political channels.
 Of course, in the process of work on the draft resolution, there were some moments of haste and some rather nervous times; but what is most important is the result.
 Each time the Council has demonstrated firmness and a consistent position, this has promoted a shift by the Iraqi leadership to a position of realism - as, in any case, it should.
 That circumstance played a significant role in our ability to achieve a positive decision by the Iraqi leadership concerning the withdrawal of troops from the south of Iraq, and thus make a positive contribution to the resolution of the present crisis.
 This, we could say, was a unique opportunity to talk with the leaders.
 Thus its content, including those parts relating to the need to recognize Kuwait and its borders, is now known to the Iraqi people.
 This alone made the trip to Baghdad worthwhile.
 I wish once again to emphasize that none of these provisions has conditions attached or is linked to the present crisis.
 Unfortunately, I cannot fail to note that some of my colleagues were hasty in making their assessments.
 I hope that they are simply some of the inevitable obstacles on the path of partnership and are now things of the past.
 In this connection, I should like to emphasize in particular that if, so far, the question of monitoring has not been linked to the recognition of Kuwait, which flows from the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, the joint declaration states the position more tightly, thus improving the interpretation.
 In other words, it is clearly stated that monitoring can begin after Iraq's official recognition of the sovereignty and borders of Kuwait.
 This greater clarity, in our view, improves the prospects and will promote the Security Council's ability to demonstrate greater determination in reacting to Iraq's actions.
 This means giving thought to a realistic programme for further action concerning implementation of the Council's resolutions on Iraq.
 Since I do not often have the opportunity to speak in the Security Council, I should like to take this opportunity to share some views concerning the improvement of its activities in settling crisis situations and conflicts on a broader level.
 I should like first of all to note with satisfaction that in our view the Council has over the last few years convincingly demonstrated its effectiveness and its ability to cope with many situations that cause concern among the international community.
 Solid experience has been gained and, in fact, a whole range of instrumentalities has been elaborated that has shown its effectiveness in exerting an impact on the parties to conflicts.
 Both the positive and the negative elements, both achievements and setbacks, deserve thorough consideration in a collective manner to ensure that the Council works effectively.
 Without claiming to be comprehensive or exhaustive, I should like to share with the Council some thoughts concerning an instrument such as sanctions.
 They have been and remain the most powerful non-military means of exerting an impact in accordance with the United Nations Charter on those who violate the international legal order.
 It is most important that the criteria to be taken into consideration should be the achievement of the goals set out by the Security Council, a solid legal basis, and consistency and rigour in the interpretation of decisions taken.
 We believe that certain corrections must be made in the sphere of application of sanctions, primarily as regards developing and improving the machinery for applying and lifting sanctions.
 If we look at the experience we have acquired, we see a significant inconsistency.
 For example, I noted that following the inauguration of the legally elected President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, it was only some time afterwards that the Security Council took a decision to lift the sanctions, although we all saw on television the triumphant rejoicing over that historic event.
 In a word, we see here a very varied and, in my view, not fully systematized practice in operation.
 This often lays the Security Council open to charges of "double standards", which, of course, is damaging to its prestige in the eyes of public opinion.
 A new phenomenon has emerged: Sometimes we hear calls by one or another country for unilateral withdrawal from a sanctions regime.
 I think the Security Council could find a way of reaffirming what is an axiom of the United Nations Charter: that is, that decisions of the Council can be repealed only by the Council itself.
 I think that these proposals point in the right direction.
 Sanctions are a kind of sentence passed by the international community, but, as distinct from clearly defined conditions for the end of periods of punishment provided for by the norms of criminal law, these elements in our case are very often missing.
 I believe also that thought must be given to laying down clear humanitarian limits in determining sanctions.
 I believe, therefore, that in this area there is room for improvement.
 Of course, with regard to sanctions, as in other cases, we must avoid using double standards, for example in carrying out peace-keeping operations, operations designed to ensure security or - as we refer to them - peace-enforcement operations in a particular region of the world.
 I believe that in this area as well there is a great deal of scope for improving the practice of the Security Council, although on the whole it has proved itself and has acquired invaluable positive experience.
 But we must note that here too there are great extremes in terms of decision-making.
 In some cases, at the outset and as though in advance, very broad parameters are established for carrying out an operation that may number up to several thousand people.
 In others, however, the Security Council is, in my view, rather slow in reacting to the situation.
 I would recall, for example, the live television coverage, broadcast to many countries, of the statement made in this Chamber by the President of one of those countries that is suffering from a fratricidal conflict and is experiencing enormous difficulties involving thousands of refugees, bloodshed, and so on.
 That well-known leader, on several occasions, made appeals, not only from this rostrum but even earlier to the Security Council, requesting that an appropriate contingent be sent to assist in restoring calm in his country.
 However, after lengthy debates, the action was limited to sending several dozen observers, which, of course, was inadequate to deal with the tragic situation that existed in that country.
 Other similar examples could be cited.
 I should like to be correctly understood.
 Incidentally, this would also have a restraining effect on those who resort to the use of weapons and are creating those conflict situations.
 Council members themselves will have to determine the forms and methods for such work, but it seems to me that after some study and after recommendations have been formulated, then perhaps the Ministers of Foreign Affairs could meet in this Chamber.
 The crisis caused by the latest Iraqi initiatives has seriously jeopardized the progress achieved in recent months because of the good cooperation established between the Government of Iraq and the Special Commission.
 The Council could not but react to these provocations, and it indeed did so by unanimously adopting resolution 949 (1994), designed to dissuade that country from ever resorting to such methods again.
 Iraq must immediately complete the withdrawal to which it is committed.
 It must in future refrain from any movement of this kind.
 The Iraqi Government knows that it alone holds the key to that normalization.
 What we are demanding of the Iraqi authorities is, in fact, more than a legal procedure; it is a public political gesture showing that Iraq is entering a new stage in its relations with Kuwait.
 In the view of my country's authorities, this vital gesture, an indispensable precondition for the study of any positive development, would constitute a turning point.
 It is also indispensable that Iraq continue to cooperate, and in exemplary fashion, with the Special Commission, as the Security Council once again demanded the day before yesterday in its resolution 949 (1994).
 This cooperation is all the more necessary since, as Iraq knows, it is a condition for the Council's continued consideration of the application of the sanctions it decreed; furthermore, Chairman Ekeus made it a condition last week for the beginning of long-term monitoring.
 The Chairman of the Special Commission considered that an interim period was now beginning and that it would be reasonable to proceed to an evaluation of Iraq's active cooperation in six months.
 My delegation reminds the Iraqi authorities that during this period it expects them to continue to demonstrate their peaceful intentions.
 Disregard for other provisions of resolutions, whether they involve the fate of prisoners and missing persons or respect for the rights of minorities in Iraq, could only lead the international community to question Baghdad's intentions.
 The lifting of the other sanctions imposed on Iraq - apart from the application in due course of paragraph 22 of resolution 687 (1991) - will depend on the fulfilment of all of its other obligations.
 We are very aware of the suffering endured by the Iraqi population, and we deplore the fact that its Government has never wished to take advantage of the possibilities offered it under resolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991).
 Mrs. Albright (United States of America): My delegation appreciates receiving today's first-hand report from the Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation on his extensive efforts of last week.
 I hope that no Government on this Council seriously doubts the danger we avoided last week.
 My Government had convincing evidence, shared with the Council on a daily basis, that Iraq's military deployment was indeed a threat to Kuwait.
 A force of elite and regular army units, totalling some 80,000 troops, was amassing in southern Iraq in much the same way as in 1990.
 The threat was real.
 I believe that it was the decision by Member States to cooperate with the Government of Kuwait in deploying forces to the region that deterred the Baghdad regime and forced it to turn its military around.
 While there are signs that Iraq is indeed withdrawing its troops, we do not believe that the crisis is over.
 As the resolution we adopted last Saturday night explains, we must make sure that the threat of hostile action is not repeated.
 We listened with interest to the Minister's report on Iraq's readiness to deal with the issue of Kuwait's sovereignty and borders.
 Particularly welcome is the statement by the Russian Federation and virtually every member of the Council that the only way forward to the lifting of sanctions is through full implementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions.
 This Council has an opportunity every two months to review matters relating to the Iraqi sanctions regime.
 That is the time and place to discuss the issues we have heard here today.
 But let me make some initial comments on my Government's view of sanctions.
 The basic premise we have heard from some is that Iraq should be rewarded for partial compliance with some of its obligations.
 The Council should categorically reject that approach.
 These are not unreasonable requirements. They reflect the underlying premise of the Council in drafting the basic cease-fire resolution - that Iraq must satisfy the Council of its peaceful intentions before it can expect to be treated as a normal member of the international community.
 Every other Member State considers these to be minimum standards of legal international behaviour.
 To suggest that respect for the most basic principles requires constant encouragement and incentive displays graphically just how far Saddam has chosen to separate Iraq from civilized society.
 When we are dealing with a repeat offender we must be particularly vigilant.
 To answer that question in the affirmative, this Council must have confidence in the credibility of the Iraqi Government.
 On 15 November the Council should make it unmistakably clear to Saddam that he will not receive the benefit of the doubt.
 We should establish guidelines to ensure consistency and rationality in our decisions on peace-keeping.
 Mr. Keating (New Zealand): I would like to join the other members of the Council in welcoming today the Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation, Mr. Andrei Kozyrev.
 It is always a hard and lengthy road, and it is often a thankless task.
 He is of course no stranger to us; we have had many discussions with him over the past year or so.
 Today we have the opportunity, in discussing again the situation between Iraq and Kuwait, to look ahead.
 On Saturday evening we adopted unanimously a resolution which contained the Council's response to the misguided and dangerous events of the previous weeks.
 As we look ahead, we want to say that the public statement of 13 October by Iraq that it is ready to recognize Kuwait and its borders is positive.
 But a public announcement is only a small step forward.
 My delegation believes that, as the days go by and no concrete action is taken to turn it into a reality, this promise will steadily lose credibility.
 But the events of the past two weeks have, unfortunately, reopened and poured salt into the wounds of 1990.
 Our approach to the future, therefore, in the light of these events, now has to reflect not just caution, but, rather, some scepticism.
 That is the only way forward.
 If it comes, and comes quickly, the Security Council will be able to reflect the significance of such a step in its consideration of Iraq's overall compliance with Security Council resolutions.
 It will not expunge the heightened anxieties of recent weeks about Iraq's peaceful intentions, but it will improve the political atmosphere in which the Council can proceed in its successive reviews to weigh Iraq's overall compliance with Security Council resolutions.
 UNSCOM must have whatever time it needs, based solely on its professional and objective analysis of the facts, to judge whether the regime in place is capable of being effective over the long term.
 This is not the time or the place for political intrusion into that process, although satisfactory achievement of UNSCOM's technical mandate is certainly a factor upon which the Council, further down the track, will be able to draw in making political judgments.
 We are particularly grateful for the generous words with which the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation expressed his admiration for the work of this Council, particularly when innovative measures are employed, within the framework of our wise Charter, to resolve crises that are new to us.
 In the case now before us the responsibility to fulfil its obligations in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council is undoubtedly incumbent upon the Iraqi authorities.
 This Council has also listened to the position of the Iraqi regime regarding those obligations, and as expected, we have heard nothing new, even at these crucial moments.
 The President: The Council will now proceed to the consideration of its annual report to the General Assembly, the draft of which has been prepared by the Secretariat.
 As requested by the Security Council, the current draft report contains a more detailed introduction.
 The draft report also contains two new appendices, namely, appendix VII, listing communications from the President of the Security Council or the Secretary-General, and appendix VIII, which lists the reports of the Secretary-General issued during the period covered by the report.
 The draft report was circulated on 28 September 1994 to the current members of the Security Council and also to the respective members whose terms of office expired on 31 December 1993 - that is, Cape Verde, Hungary, Japan, Morocco and Venezuela - for their comments, if any.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 This decision will be reflected in a note by the President of the Security Council, to be issued as document S/1994/1176.
 The Security Council has thus concluded its consideration of the item on the agenda.
 The meeting rose at 10.50 a.m.
 The President: I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Burundi, in which he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 The President: The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
 Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Burundi, document S/1994/1152.
 "The Security Council has considered the situation in Burundi, on the basis of the Secretary-General's report (S/1994/1152).
 "The Security Council remains concerned that, despite the important political progress that has been made, much remains to be done if the climate of insecurity described by the Secretary-General in his report is to be dispelled and the country set firmly on the path of reconciliation and reconstruction.
 The Council deplores the fact that extremist elements continue to threaten national reconciliation, including through the operation of a clandestine radio station inciting ethnic hatred and violence.
 It reaffirms the importance of bringing to justice those responsible for the coup of 21 October 1993 and subsequent interethnic massacres and other violations of international humanitarian law.
 "The Security Council commends the role played by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, including in helping the new coalition Government to organize a national debate early in 1995 on the problems of relations between the two communities.
 The Council attaches importance to the success of this initiative.
 In this context, it recognizes the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the office he has established in Burundi, and notes the important role human-rights monitors might play.
 It welcomes the recent increase in the number of Organization of African Unity (OAU) military observers in Burundi.
 It encourages the OAU, United Nations agencies and Member States to continue their involvement in Burundi and to intensify political contacts and visits.
 It notes the importance of increased technical assistance from the international community as the coalition Government tackles the critical tasks of reconciliation and reconstruction.
 "The Council remains deeply concerned at the plight of refugees and displaced persons in Burundi.
 This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/1994/60.
 The meeting rose at 10.50 a.m.
 Friday, 21 October 1994, 10.50 a.m. The meeting was called to order at 10.50 a.m.
 The President: I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Liberia, in which he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 The President: The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
 Members of the Council have before them the seventh progress report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia, document S/1994/1167.
 Members also have before them document S/1994/1187, which contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior consultations.
 The first speaker is the representative of Liberia, on whom I now call.
 Mr. Bull (Liberia): I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of October.
 We are therefore assured that your skilful handling of the Council's affairs thus far will yield further positive results.
 My delegation expresses its gratitude to Ambassador Ya\x{9391}z Barnuevo of Spain for his excellent stewardship of the Security Council during the month just past.
 We welcome the comprehensive and lucid report, in document S/1994/1167 of 14 October 1994 of Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on the activities of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL).
 We thank him most sincerely for his continuing search for peace and normalcy in Liberia, which, in spite of the present setbacks, is enabling us Liberians to chart the future peaceful course of our country.
 It must be recorded, however, that forces external to the Liberian conflict continue to aid and abet the warlords through the supply of weapons and other material support.
 Those forces also provide safe havens for these warlords.
 Well-meaning Liberians are of the view that once such underpinnings are removed, those agents of death will be constrained to pursue constructive dialogue and national reconciliation as the better alternative to war.
 We therefore appeal to those who provide sanctuary and support to the warlords to discontinue such actions.
 The ECOWAS Military Observer Group (ECOMOG) has continued to play a most constructive role in the peace process, and we remain grateful to ECOWAS and to the troop-contributing countries for their sacrificial services to Liberia at this stage in our history.
 The recent attempted coup d'at by certain elements of the armed forces of Liberia and the successful foiling of that plot by ECOMOG only accentuate the necessity for the international community to support ECOMOG and also to remain engaged in Liberia until peaceful change is achieved.
 My delegation joins the Secretary-General and the Security Council in the appeal for increased financial assistance to the Trust Fund for Liberia to enable ECOMOG to fulfil its mandate.
 The Liberian National Transitional Government has taken into account the recommendations of the National Conference and is cooperating with President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, current Chairman of ECOWAS, in an effort to advance the peace process.
 In this post-cold-war era, the laudable and pioneering efforts of the United Nations in collaborating with a subregional organization in conflict resolution must not be allowed to fail because of a lack of resolve by the international community.
 The overwhelming majority of Liberians, the innocent victims of the conflict, are relying on and deserve the goodwill and support of the international community to help end their suffering.
 The Liberian conflict has long ceased to be an internal matter.
 African conflicts, like others, deserve the full attention of the Security Council.
 Only a policy of empathetic inclusion can propel humankind towards its cherished dream of peace and social progress.
 Liberia needs that empathy now.
 The draft resolution before the Council addresses some of my Government's concerns. I therefore commend it to the Council and request its unanimous adoption.
 The President: It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
 If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 Mr. Gambari (Nigeria): The political and security situation in Liberia is precarious, and this has been especially true in the past few months.
 We all face in Liberia a stark choice between, on the one hand, abandonment and despair, and on the other, the wisdom and courage to support a unique regional initiative, the first of its kind, perhaps, in our continent.
 Unlike in the crises in the Horn of Africa and in Central Africa - Somalia and Rwanda, respectively - where there were no clear-cut regional initiatives, as there is in Liberia, ECOMOG has truly made the difference between a certain order, however precarious, and total chaos.
 None the less, without adequate international financial and logistical support, ECOMOG's efforts to establish peace in Liberia may soon come to an abrupt end.
 ECOMOG must be enabled to execute its mandate of encamping, disarming and demobilizing the Liberian factions so that the remaining processes leading to the holding of democratic elections in Liberia can be achieved.
 At this point in the evolution of the peace process, the Liberia factions, who alone must bear full responsibility for its continuing lack of progress, should be made to realize the futility of further intransigence and the necessity to opt for dialogue and peace, and to do so soon.
 In this connection, Nigeria believes that the best chance of moving the peace process forward lies in finding new ways of making the existing Cotonou Agreement work rather than in arguing about yet another problematic accord or agreement.
 We therefore hope and expect that this commitment on the part of the international community will find concrete expression in terms of new financial and logistical support for ECOMOG forces in Liberia.
 Secondly, the draft resolution reiterates the call, which this Council has made in previous resolutions, for the full application of an arms embargo on the Liberian warring parties.
 We commend this provision of the draft resolution.
 In this connection it is necessary to mention that several States, including my own, that are contributing troops to the Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) have served notice that without new financial assistance they will seriously consider withdrawing their troops from Liberia.
 We feel that it would be wiser to allow the Secretary-General, as we have done in almost every other case, to use his discretion to continue to deploy UNOMIL personnel as and when appropriate.
 The President: The Security Council will now proceed to the vote on the draft resolution contained in document S/1994/1187.
 The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as resolution 950 (1994).
 Today, however, recent events described in the report of the Secretary-General dated 14 October 1994 lead us to recognize the volatility and grave seriousness of the situation in Liberia.
 Liberian parties must realize that there is no military alternative that can solve their political differences.
 Yet some Liberian factions have failed to demonstrate commitment and political will for the implementation of the Cotonou Agreement.
 The leaders of the Liberian parties must realize that their stalemate not only affects their country but also has an adverse impact on the stability of Liberia's neighbours and on that of the entire subregion.
 Although the current prospects for national reconciliation are bleak, political events that have taken place recently may give us some encouragement.
 We believe that the meeting of the leaders of the warring factions sponsored by the President of Ghana, current Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the subsequent Akosombo Agreement, and the Liberian National Conference will have a positive impact on the overall peace process.
 While we welcome these developments, we stress the need for the decisions taken to be implemented without delay so that the process of national reconciliation can regain much-needed momentum.
 Dialogue between the parties must proceed if political accommodation is to be found within the framework of the Cotonou Agreement, which continues to be the only framework for peace in Liberia.
 We should not lose sight of the fact that this temporary measure, as it is described in paragraph 33 of the report of the Secretary-General (S/1994/1167), was adopted in view of the lack of security in some parts of Liberia.
 It is certainly the Secretary-General's prerogative to take decisions on force strength, provided that they do not violate the authorized level determined by the Security Council.
 It is undeniable that circumstances sometimes require changes or adaptations of mandates in the light of new realities.
 In this particular case, however, since UNOMIL has not been altered, there should not be a change in the mandate or the concept of the Mission, with the imposition of non-existent conditionalities.
 We look forward to considering its report and recommendations.
 My delegation voted in favour of resolution 950 (1994) because it represents yet another earnest attempt by the international community to contribute to the peace process in Liberia.
 We also wish to recognize the contribution of ECOWAS, in particular its current Chairman, President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, as well as of the ECOMOG troop contributors, which are sparing no efforts to enhance the chances of peace in Liberia.
 Despite the commendable diplomatic efforts to bring the Liberian factions together made by the current Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Ghanaian President Rawlings, which we fully support, there is thus far no peace in Liberia.
 Despite the commendable efforts of Nigerian, Tanzanian, Ugandan and other forces of the Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) of ECOWAS to provide security, Liberia is still engulfed in civil war.
 But the firing has not ceased.
 Instead, UNOMIL observers have been abused and humiliated by the warlords whose country they came to protect.
 Humanitarian relief workers came to help. Yet they have been harassed and treated inhumanely.
 In our view, given the precarious situation in Liberia, they should not go back until the Security Council decides to send them back.
 "any decision to return [UNOMIL] to the authorized level will depend on consideration by the Security Council of a further report from the Secretary-General reflecting a real improvement in the situation on the ground, in particular the security situation".
 We have hope for Liberia.
 But it is a hope that can only be fulfilled by the determination of the people of Liberia to say No to civil war, by a commitment of all Liberians to peace.
 Mr. Mim\x{5daa} (France)(interpretation from French): France voted in favour of extending the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) until 13 January 1995 and approves the Secretary-General's conclusions set forth in his seventh progress report on UNOMIL.
 The signing of agreements accepted by all the Liberian factions the Cotonou Agreement, in particular, but also the Akosombo Agreement, on which the Chairman of ECOWAS has expended much effort has been encouraging in this respect.
 However, recent events have shown that much remains to be done.
 The parties must truly respect those agreements.
 I would add that human rights must be respected in Liberia, fully and scrupulously.
 The extension of the UNOMIL mandate must therefore be a signal to the parties to engage, in good faith and unremittingly, in the peace process in Liberia.
 Mr. Cdenas (Argentina) (interpretation from Spanish): I should like at the outset to thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on the situation in Liberia.
 The situation described causes us great concern about the continuation of hostilities.
 In view of the prevailing insecurity, we believe it right to extend UNOMIL's mandate until 13 January 1995.
 We also view with deep concern the intention expressed by some contributors of troops to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to withdraw their contingents from the Group.
 We can understand their position, the result of serious supply problems and the lack of any concrete political progress in Liberia.
 Accordingly, we view as especially timely the Secretary-General's proposal to send a high-level mission to consult with States members of ECOWAS on how the international community can best continue to assist the peace process in Liberia.
 The success of that common endeavour is the key to their future.
 We commend the efforts to restore peace to Liberia being made by the countries contributing troops to UNOMIL and ECOMOG, by humanitarian organizations and by Member States that have contributed to the United Nations Trust Fund for Liberia.
 We find absolutely unacceptable attacks by armed Liberian factions against the personnel of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL), the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS) Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) and other international organizations, and we resolutely condemn such actions.
 The Russian delegation voted in favour of the resolution adopted today, which provides for the extension of UNOMIL's mandate, because we believe it sends a clear signal to the Liberian factions that the present stagnation of the peace process is unacceptable.
 We regard it as highly important that the resolution calls upon all States strictly to abide by and comply with the general and complete embargo on all deliveries of weapons and military equipment to Liberia.
 The President: The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
 Members of the Council have before them document S/1994/1188, which contains a note dated 20 October 1994 by the Secretary-General concerning the date of an election to fill a vacancy in the International Court of Justice. This note explains the need for this item on our agenda.
 He represented the former USSR in numerous United Nations bodies.
 Judge Tarassov was also head of the USSR delegation to the Vienna talks on mutual reductions of force and armaments in Central Europe from 1976 to 1981.
 He was a distinguished member of the Russian International Law Association.
 His term of office would have expired on 5 February 1997.
 As I reported to members during our prior consultations on this matter, the election should take place on 26 January 1995 at a meeting of the Security Council, and at a meeting of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session.
 Members of the Council have before them document S/1994/1189, which contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's consultations.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 In the light of the consultations which I have held, it is my understanding that the Council is ready to adopt the draft resolution contained in document S/1994/1189 without a vote.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 The draft resolution has been adopted as resolution 951 (1994).
 The meeting rose at 11.35 a.m.
 The President: I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Mozambique, in which he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 The President: The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
 The Security Council has been following closely the progress made by the Government of Mozambique and the Resist\x{763d}cia Nacional Mo\x{84f7}mbicana (RENAMO) towards the implementation of the General Peace Agreement for Mozambique.
 The Security Council believes that the necessary conditions have now been established for the holding of free and fair elections on 27 and 28 October under effective national and international monitoring.
 The Security Council reiterates its intention to endorse the results of the elections should the United Nations declare them free and fair, and reminds the parties of their obligation, under the General Peace Agreement, fully to abide by the results.
 The Security Council takes this opportunity to express its appreciation to the Secretary-General, his Special Representative and the personnel of ONUMOZ and calls upon the parties to continue to cooperate with them to ensure the fulfilment of ONUMOZ's mandate, including verification of their complete demobilization and disarmament.
 This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/1994/61.
 The meeting rose at 3.55 p.m.
 The President: I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Angola in which he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 At the invitation of the President, Mr. Van Dunem Mbinda (Angola) took a place at the Council table.
 The President: The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
 Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 We commend also the personnel of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II), in particular the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Blondin Beye, and the Force Commander, Major-General Chris Garuba, for their tireless efforts, which have been pivotal in achieving this success.
 The present draft resolution rightly recognizes that the recent development apropos the Lusaka talks, though no doubt a significant event in itself, is none the less only the first step in a long process ahead for a peaceful settlement in Angola.
 Much remains to be done within the framework of the Acordos de Paz and relevant Security Council resolutions to bring the Angolan settlement to full effect and to sustain it fully.
 My delegation therefore supports the tenor of the draft resolution before us, which, among other things, calls upon the parties to honour their commitment already made at the Lusaka talks and to conclude without further delay a comprehensive agreement to that effect.
 It is also important that the parties redouble their efforts to establish an effective and sustainable cease-fire throughout Angola so that the pending agreement will not be put in peril.
 We believe that the Security Council has got it exactly right by extending UNAVEM lI's mandate until 8 December 1994.
 My delegation fully supports this readiness and sees it as a further assurance to the parties and to the people of Angola that the international community remains committed to the satisfactory resolution of their conflict, which has caused untold hardships and incalculable loss of life.
 We shall support this draft resolution.
 The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as resolution 952 (1994).
 Mrs. Albright (United States of America): Angola has been racked by war for more than 20 years, with millions of Angolan victims.
 One of Africa's richest countries has become one of its poorest nations.
 The real question is whether Angola can become a real nation; we hope so.
 The Lusaka Peace Talks will soon produce a peace agreement.
 The question is whether they will produce real peace; we hope so on that point also.
 We understand the importance of the presence of United Nations observers in the early stages of the peace process, when confidence-building measures and a re-establishment of trust between the parties will be sorely needed.
 If the parties want the international community to help them in their attempts at peace-making, they must lay down their arms.
 The tasks of a military officer can never be considered risk-free, but we will not recklessly expose these officers to needless risks, and we will insist that a cease-fire be declared in order to minimize the risks.
 Similarly, before deploying an enlarged force of peace-keeping troops into Angola, my Government will want to see evidence that the parties are serious about holding to a cease-fire and implementing the peace agreement.
 As the resolution we have adopted says, we are ready to consider promptly the Secretary-General's recommendations for an expanded United Nations presence after the Lusaka peace agreement has been formally signed.
 We consider that today's resolution gives the Secretary-General a good deal of latitude to deploy logistical and humanitarian planners to lay the ground for further United Nations involvement in Angola and to finalize his contingency plans.
 We urge them both to show the requisite flexibility and resolve to move quickly through the remaining technical details and sign the agreement in accordance with the timetable laid out by the Secretary-General's Special Representative.
 The future of Angola rests in their hands.
 This extension is a special one.
 In fact, the Council is now authorizing the restoration of UNAVEM II strength to its previous level.
 In my delegation's view, this last condition seems especially justified because the report of the Secretary-General mentions the continuation of fighting on the ground.
 The durability of the peace agreement must be guaranteed by the complete cessation of hostilities between the parties, and deeds must finally live up to stated intentions.
 Mr. Sardenberg (Brazil): The comprehensive report of the Secretary-General dated 20 October last, for which we are grateful, provides the Security Council with information on the situation in Angola and on the latest political developments regarding the next steps in the Peace Process.
 The adoption of resolution 952 (1994) can indeed represent a turning-point in United Nations involvement in the issue, thus opening the door for its expanded presence in Angola.
 The restoration of the strength of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II) to its previous level of 350 military observers and 126 police observers, as decided by the Security Council, is an important measure.
 It is intended to contribute in an impartial manner to consolidating the initial, and most critical, stage of the peace agreement to be reached.
 My Government is of the view that the Mission in Angola has to be adequately staffed in order to be capable of successfully discharging its complex, important and impartial mandate, especially in the beginning, as we are committed to entering a new period on a sound and solid basis.
 Paragraph 4 of resolution 952 (1994) is very clear.
 In the meantime, we consider that he can set in motion the relevant planning for the deployment of this expanded contingent of military and police observers.
 We firmly trust that the parties will soon conclude work on all the remaining technical issues and thus ensure a final comprehensive political settlement.
 We welcome the decision taken by the Government of Angola to initial the agreement. We earnestly encourage the Uni\x{7dcc} Nacional para a Independencia Total de Angola (UNITA) to act likewise.
 The parties must show the required flexibility and renew their commitment to peace.
 We wish to thank the Secretariat for the contingency planning done to date.
 We take this opportunity to reiterate the commitment of the Brazilian Government to contribute with military personnel to UNAVEM III, soon to be established.
 We hope that by 8 December the conditions will exist to enable the Security Council to consider seriously and, if circumstances warrant it, to decide on expanding the United Nations presence in Angola.
 We applaud the progress achieved in recent weeks in Lusaka by the Angolan Government and UNITA, with the assistance of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Blondin Beye, and with the help of the three observer States and a number of States of the region.
 To prove their firm commitment, the parties must establish and respect an effective cease-fire upon the initialling of the Lusaka Protocol, so as to end a situation on the ground which has not thus far mirrored the progress achieved at the negotiating table.
 It is regrettable that hostilities have not yet ended and that some continue to seek military successes, which can only serve to undermine the process in the eyes of the international community and exacerbate the humanitarian situation in the country.
 The desire to achieve a political settlement must therefore be reflected in an immediate cessation of hostilities.
 The future of their country demands this.
 Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): The Russian Federation hails the positive results recently achieved in the Lusaka negotiations, which bring an end to a complex and important stage in the negotiating process among Angolans, and which guide that process towards a positive conclusion.
 The Lusaka Protocol, we all hope, will be initialled in a few days' time.
 This will be a major step towards the restoration of peace in Angola.
 In that connection, we note the important role played in achieving these positive results by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Blondin Beye, by the three observer States and by the countries of the region.
 With the necessary political will, the parties can carry out those tasks successfully.
 An important step in furthering the implementation of the peace agreement will be the restoration of United Nations military and police observers to their previous level, as agreed today by the Council.
 Mr. Li Zhaoxing (China) (interpretation from Chinese): With the assistance of the international community, the two Angolan parties have finally made a breakthrough after nearly a year of arduous negotiations.
 The peace process for Angola is therefore at a crucial historic moment. These are all very encouraging developments.
 We will, as always, together with other members of the international community, make our own contributions to a comprehensive political solution to the Angolan conflict.
 The Security Council has adopted this resolution at an important and delicate moment in the long-drawn-out peace process in Angola.
 The British Government is encouraged by the progress made recently in the Lusaka Peace Talks and urges the parties to initial the agreement this weekend and establish and implement an effective and sustainable cease-fire.
 We remain deeply concerned at the continuation of military hostilities, which have inflicted appalling suffering on the people of Angola and delayed time and again progress in the Lusaka Peace Talks.
 The parties really must now heed this demand.
 Once the agreement has been reached it will make it even less tolerable that they should pursue a twin-track approach of negotiating and fighting at the same time.
 By these actions, the Council has demonstrated its continued commitment to Angola.
 If peace-keepers are to deploy, there must be a peace to keep.
 We also remain concerned at the serious humanitarian situation in Angola.
 My Government, along with many others, has contributed generously to the humanitarian relief programmes, and we will continue to offer what assistance we can.
 I now resume my functions as President of the Council.
 There are no further speakers on my list.
 I am sure I speak for all members of the Security Council in expressing deep appreciation to Ambassador Hannay for the great diplomatic skill and unfailing courtesy with which he conducted the Council's business last month.
 The President: I should like to inform the Council that I have received letters from the representatives of Kenya and Somalia in which they request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 At the invitation of the President, Ms. Hassan (Somalia) took a place at the Council table; Mr. Muthaura (Kenya) took the place reserved for him at the side of the Council Chamber.
 The President: The Security Council will now resume its consideration of the item on its agenda.
 Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General concerning the situation in Somalia, contained in documents S/1994/1068 and S/1994/1166.
 Members of the Council also have before them document S/1994/1242, which contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior consultations.
 Mr. Muthaura (Kenya): First of all, Madam President, I wish to thank you for allowing me to make a contribution to the Council's debate on the situation in Somalia.
 May I also take this opportunity to congratulate your predecessor, Sir David Hannay, Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom, on his successful presidency during the month of October 1994.
 Kenya, being a neighbour of Somalia, with which it shares a boundary of 800 kilometres and the same ethnic population in the border area, cannot but take great interest in the situation in Somalia, which is the agenda item before the Council today.
 It is approximately three years since the Security Council decided to deploy the United Nations Operation in Somalia UNOSOM I, which later was succeeded by UNOSOM II.
 The most disturbing experience was the first phase of the Somalia conflict, which was a combination of civil war and severe famine.
 Those two disasters left about half a million dead, and about 2 million people were pushed into the neighbouring countries as refugees not to mention the thousands who were displaced in Somalia itself.
 It is imperative that the Council take cognizance of this important achievement while deliberating on the future of UNOSOM and of the United Nations in Somalia.
 UNOSOM provided a stabilizing environment that made possible the delivery of humanitarian assistance and the rehabilitation of some essential infrastructure, and, more important, secured the main air and seaports as well as the major roads for humanitarian activities.
 We commend UNOSOM, the humanitarian agencies and the non-governmental agencies for their contribution in Somalia.
 We pay tribute to the peace-keepers and the humanitarian personnel all these people who lost their lives in Somalia in the service of humanity.
 The neighbouring countries, including my own, have shouldered the heavy burden arising out of the Somalia conflict.
 My Government would like this important concern to be given adequate consideration by the Council as it discusses the future of UNOSOM.
 As stated earlier, at the peak of the crisis neighbouring countries hosted at least 2 million Somali refugees.
 Along with the influx of refugees was widespread infiltration of armed bandits and dangerous weapons into the neighbouring countries, resulting in serious destabilization of the border region.
 Since 1992, Kenya has lost about 1,000 of its civilian population and 87 members of its security personnel in more than a total of 12,634 banditry incidents directly associated with the spill-over of the conflict in Somalia.
 The loss of livestock and property has been extensive: 30,470 head of cattle, 27,706 goats and 10,609 sheep have so far been lost to the Somali bandits.
 This clearly underscores the regional dimension of the Somali conflict as a serious threat to Kenya's security and to the economic system in the border region.
 My country has on occasion made strong appeals to the Secretary-General to deploy UNOSOM troops for border patrols alongside Kenyan security personnel to minimize these incidents of border violations, but so far we have received no tangible response from UNOSOM.
 UNOSOM has been instrumental in providing the necessary stabilizing factor that has enabled this process to continue.
 In addition, it is important that the humanitarian rehabilitation and reconstruction processes be continued and expanded to ensure the resettlement of the 500,000 refugees and 400,000 displaced persons, as highlighted in paragraph 11 of the Secretary-General's report (S/1994/1166).
 While we agree that the Somali leaders are squarely responsible for the continued interfactional fighting and the destruction of the Somali State, apportioning blame is not enough.
 The Council must take all necessary precautions and safeguards to ensure that there is no escalation of the conflict after UNOSOM's departure.
 In that regard, waiting a little longer to allow the establishment of a central authority in Somalia through the ongoing national reconciliation efforts appears the most logical way forward.
 Even then, UNOSOM would have to be phased out gradually to avoid a vacuum.
 Any escalation of the conflict after the departure of UNOSOM would definitely jeopardize humanitarian and rehabilitation efforts and trigger new waves of refugees, which the neighbouring countries could not cope with.
 Increased banditry in the border region could lead to more serious regional conflicts, which the Council should avoid at this stage.
 As the casualty figures I have already mentioned clearly indicate, this situation should not be allowed to continue.
 The President: I thank the representative of Kenya for his kind words addressed to me.
 Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.
 There being no objection, it is so decided.
 Mr. Keating (New Zealand): Let me first offer my congratulations, Madam President, on your assumption of the presidency for this month of November and my thanks and the thanks of my delegation to Ambassador Hannay and his team for the excellent leadership they gave us during October.
 This is partly explained by the fact that New Zealanders have been involved in all stages of the international effort to rescue the Somali people from famine and the ravages of a horrible civil conflict.
 New Zealanders were involved at the outset in the humanitarian relief efforts.
 New Zealand military forces with troops and aircraft served with the Unified Task Force (UNITAF), and thereafter a New Zealand military contingent has served with the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II).
 Indeed, it was a matter of great pride for me, as leader of the Security Council Mission to Somalia last week, that when the Mission was briefed by the Force Commander in Mogadishu one of the principal briefers was a New Zealand officer.
 Most of the Western countries have long since removed all their troops.
 But New Zealand and Australia although our contingents are small in number and are scheduled to depart towards the end of November have remained.
 But our reasons for participating so closely in the Council's work on Somalia go beyond that.
 We believe very strongly that the United Nations was right to respond to the crisis in Somalia in the way that it did.
 But humanitarian concerns were not the only basis for action.
 The security of neighbouring countries was threatened.
 The situation in Somalia spread itself across borders, with flows of refugees, fighting, instability and very significant economic costs to neighbouring States, such as we have just heard from the Ambassador of Kenya.
 We have almost no historical or other connections with it.
 In this regard, the needs and concerns of Africa have been heeded; whether it be Somalia, Rwanda, Mozambique or Angola all these countries have found ready support from New Zealand in the Council.
 We are therefore very pleased that this draft resolution restores consensus in the Council.
 We believe that the Security Council mission played an important part in achieving this.
 It established a common understanding about the situation on the ground.
 It established that UNOSOM had, in effect, achieved all it could achieve in Somalia.
 Neither the Somali parties nor the providers of humanitarian assistance requested that it be extended beyond the promised date of March next year.
 A great deal has been written and said about the international community's intervention to help the Somali people.
 Too much of it has been sensationalized.
 Mistakes along the way were inevitable.
 But the fundamental humanitarian goal was achieved.
 Famine no longer stalks the land in Somalia.
 I believe we can look back and say that the risks that were taken, and the financial costs that were incurred were worth it.
 On the political front, we did not succeed in forcing peace and reconciliation on the Somali parties.
 But the Somali parties were given a reasonable period of relative stability, created by UNOSOM's military presence, in which to begin a serious process of political reconciliation.
 The Security Council mission told the faction leaders very bluntly when we were in Mogadishu last week that this failure and the future of their people rested squarely on their shoulders.
 The window of opportunity is still open but, as was always foreseen, the military umbrella, the blue blanket, could not be sustained by the United Nations forever.
 March 1995 has been underlined as the necessary and appropriate date for the final termination of the UNOSOM military presence.
 The demands on United Nations peace-keeping elsewhere, not least in other parts of Africa, mean that we cannot justify such an enormous military presence for a longer period.
 The natural question which follows is: what about the future? And this is indeed an important question which the Security Council mission had to address.
 We heard from the donor community working out of Nairobi.
 The Council has heard the mission's conclusions.
 The United Nations is not going to abandon Somalia.
 The Somali leaders all saw value in an ongoing United Nations political presence to facilitate and assist with ongoing efforts towards national reconciliation.
 The justice programme, involving the re-establishment of a responsible police force and working court structure, is also worthy of continued support.
 However, the Security Council mission had to warn the Somali factions that all this would be in jeopardy if attacks on United Nations and non-governmental organization personnel were to recur, as in the past.
 They were warned that only a genuinely inclusive approach to national reconciliation would produce the kind of security environment in which the international community could continue to operate in Somalia and help the Somali people.
 We underline this message again today.
 But what happens if the faction leaders ignore our warnings and the worst occurs?
 Starvation need not loom as an immediate problem.
 Secondly, many parts of the country have stabilized, with local administration working to quite good effect.
 In some areas this relative stability is very much due to the efforts of UNOSOM and UNITAF.
 My delegation has therefore urged that this draft resolution must also address the future.
 First, it emphasizes the absolute importance the Security Council attaches to the safety and security of United Nations, non-governmental organization and humanitarian personnel.
 Thirdly, it underlines the importance of ongoing humanitarian assistance.
 Fourthly, it recognizes the impacts on neighbouring countries.
 Fifthly, it notes the interest of humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations in cooperating with the United Nations after the withdrawal of UNOSOM in transitional arrangements.
 We are very much aware that after the withdrawal of UNOSOM much of the responsibility for these matters will shift away from the Security Council.
 We have proposed therefore, and are pleased that this is reflected in operative paragraph 13, that the situation should continue to be monitored closely.
 The security situation, humanitarian relief requirements, the situation of the humanitarian workers, the impacts on neighbouring countries: all these need to be the subject of ongoing vigilance.
 And in the draft resolution the Council asks the Secretary-General, in the light of developments, not only to keep the Security Council informed, but also to reflect creatively about the role the United Nations could continue to play.
 In this vein, it is also essential that we underline that the last thing Somalia needs at this critical time is more weaponry.
 Yet the arms trade continues.
 This draft resolution insists that the arms embargo must be respected, and we call on all concerned to shoulder their responsibilities in this regard.
 And those with influence on the parties and factions in Somalia must use that influence to promote peace and inclusive national reconciliation.
 Finally, we believe there is a need today, at this turning-point in United Nations history, to recognize and thank some very special people.
 We honour first those who went to Somalia at the outset of the crisis, civilian aid workers from the United Nations agencies and volunteers from the community of non-governmental organizations.
 They went at great risk, without military security, and far too many of these generous people lost their lives.
 We recognize also those in the international media and others who brought the Somalia crisis so graphically to our attention.
 Their contribution was also of major significance.
 The Secretary-General bravely set out the framework for the decision leading to the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM I).
 That should never be forgotten.
 We still find it beyond belief that so many cowardly and irrational attacks would be made upon international personnel whose only interest in Somalia was to save Somali women and children from starvation.
 And that takes us the full circle; it sums up why it is time for the United Nations military component to go.
 Somalia has been brought back from the precipice.
 The future is in their hands, but we cannot force them to grasp it.
 The President: I thank the representative of New Zealand for his kind words addressed to me.
 Mr. Al-Khussaiby (Oman): Allow me to begin by conveying to you, Madam President, my sincere congratulations on your assumption of the Council's presidency for this month.
 That goal can be achieved only through the implementation of the agreed objectives and the future realization of a prosperous future that will satisfy the ambitions and aspirations of the Somali people.
 The President: I thank the representative of Oman for his kind words addressed to me.
 Mr. Dorani (Djibouti) (interpretation from French): My delegation is pleased to have this opportunity to congratulate you, Madam President, on your election to the presidency of the Security Council.
 We also wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to the delegation of the United Kingdom, led by its Permanent Representative, Sir David Hannay, for the remarkable work it accomplished last month.
 We say to them: You have held an entire population hostage to your madness and your animal instincts long enough.
 You have humiliated your women and your children long enough.
 We wish to address their conscience, if they still have one, to say to them: Forget the deadly errors of the past and take advantage of lessons learned.
 Considerable progress has been made in this field, even in such sectors of production as agriculture and livestock, when we consider the state of the country two years ago.
 At a time when Arabs and Israelis are sitting down together, when South Africans, black and white, are building a new nation together, it is sad for us to see the only nation in the true sense of the term, in sub-Saharan Africa being destroyed by its sons.
 In conclusion, I wish to pay tribute to the efforts undertaken by the Unified Task Force (UNITAF), by all of the civilian and military personnel of UNOSOM and by the non-governmental organizations, which continue to work in difficult circumstances.
 We wish to express our sincere condolences to the Governments and the families of those who have lost their lives in Somalia; their sacrifice will be for ever in our memories.
 The President: I thank the representative of Djibouti for his kind words addressed to me.
 We are confident that under your leadership, the Council's business will be in good hands throughout this month.
 The United Nations has not failed in Somalia, but it has failed despite its best efforts to persuade the Somali leaders to put the interests of their people above their own political ambitions and struggle for power.
 This morning the Council takes a very important decision on Somalia: whether to extend the mandate of the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II) for one final period until 31 March 1995.
 It was the purpose of this Council to give the Somali factions one last chance when a week or so ago it sent a special mission to Mogadishu.
 Everything we saw left the members of the mission with a profound sense of unease and a fear that political reconciliation or the emergence of a broad-based government which is widely acceptable is far from certain.
 It is particularly sad for my country, which has joined some of the States Members of this Organization in contributing troops to UNOSOM and, in our case and in some of theirs, losing some of our finest soldiers in active service in Somalia.
 As the Secretary-General has indicated in his report, the establishment of a viable and acceptable peace can come only from the Somalis themselves; it cannot be imposed by the international community.
 However, this resolution recognizes that the international community has a continuing role and responsibility in facilitating the political process leading to the establishment of a viable administration for the benefit of the Somali people in Somalia.
 This is desirable and should be pursued, in our opinion.
 The international community has to take positive steps to solve this problem.
 The President: I thank the representative of Nigeria for the kind words he addressed to me.
 I shall now put to the vote the draft resolution contained in document S/1994/1242.
 The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as resolution 954 (1994).
 Mr. Mim\x{5daa} (France) (interpretation from French): Madam President, my delegation is pleased to see you in charge of the business of the Security Council in this month of November.
 The Council is in good hands, just as it was last month under the effective and wise guidance of the Ambassador of the United Nations, whom we thank very sincerely.
 My delegation voted in favour of the draft resolution, which reflects all the concerns expressed by the Security Council mission that visited the theatre of operations from 24 to 27 October.
 The United Nations intervention in Somalia originally had as its main objective putting an end to the famine in that country ruined by the rivalries of warlords which led to the deaths of more than 300,000 people.
 That objective has been fully achieved.
 These factions bear the responsibility for what might now happen in Somalia.
 It is to be feared that the departure of the blue helmets might be accompanied by an explosion of violence, which is why my country wanted the Council to issue a strong reminder that it decreed a military embargo at the beginning of 1992.
 This embargo must be fully applied.
 The sanctions Committee set up to that end must fulfil the mandate entrusted to it by resolution 751 (1992).
 The Somali factions must also be warned against any looting of UNOSOM property, which the blue helmets are authorized to prevent by force.
 In five months' time UNOSOM's mandate will be terminated and the blue helmets will be fully withdrawn.
 These valuable months must be used to keep trying to reach agreement between the factions and to avoid triggering a spiral of violence.
 My delegation is therefore pleased that the Secretary-General, in his report of 14 October, states that he has asked his Special Representative to continue efforts to that end.
 It is important also to stress that the countries of the region and the regional organizations in contact with Somalia have a crucial role to play in the settlement of the Somali crisis.
 These tasks can be continued beyond 31 March 1995, as we hope, only if the factions agree to cooperate and to give Somalia a chance to set out again on the road to progress and democracy.
 The President: I thank the representative of France for his kind words addressed to me.
 Mr. Marker (Pakistan): Madam President, it is a source of great pleasure for my delegation, and for me personally, to see you presiding over the deliberations of the Security Council.
 The most pleasant memories of your previous tenure as the Council President are still fresh in our minds, and we are confident that your diplomatic skill, erudition and vast experience will ensure that we cope with the heavy workload for this month with success.
 Let me pledge to you the complete cooperation of my delegation.
 The resolution indeed represents an acknowledgement of the fact that, despite all the best intentions and dedicated efforts, the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) has not been able to fully deliver on the mandate given to it.
 The responsibility for this lies squarely with the Somali leaders, who, having twice reached formal agreements on the modalities and framework for the national reconciliation process, failed to keep their word.
 It has been rightly contended that all that the United Nations could do in the context of the efforts towards political reconciliation in Somalia was to act as a facilitator and a mediator.
 Dozens of United Nations peace-keepers from many countries have even made the supreme sacrifice of their lives while serving in Somalia in the cause of peace.
 While we have not been successful in getting the Somali political reconciliation process moving at a pace which could be described as being even remotely satisfactory, we cannot ignore the achievements of UNOSOM in the humanitarian sector.
 Without the timely intervention of the United Nations, other international agencies, non-governmental organizations and the international community at large, the famine, the internecine conflict and the humanitarian nightmare that ravaged Somalia could have led to a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions.
 Today, considerable agricultural and economic activity has returned to Somalia.
 The Secretary-General needs to have flexibility in the conduct of the withdrawal as long as every effort is made to complete it before the end of March 1995.
 Indeed, if all the requisite air and naval assets are made available in a timely and properly coordinated manner, the last UNOSOM II soldier could be out of Somalia well before 31 March 1995.
 The Government of Pakistan has decided to provide two frigates and an auxiliary vessel to assist in the process.
 We are grateful for the honour done to Pakistan with the inclusion in the mission of a member of our delegation.
 I would also wish to express my delegation's deep appreciation for the splendid work done by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, all members of UNOSOM II and the many non-governmental organizations and specialized agencies.
 They have worked under the most difficult conditions with a spirit of devotion and dedication that has been wholly admirable.
 The President: I thank the representative of Pakistan for his kind words addressed to me.
 The Chinese delegation therefore voted in favour of the resolution just adopted.
 Though UNOSOM II has to leave Somalia before attaining its goal of facilitating national reconciliation among the various Somali factions, it should try to avoid, to the best of its ability, creating adverse effects.
 In this regard, the United Nations should not only continue but also strengthen its efforts of peaceful mediation, and international humanitarian assistance should not come to a halt.
 The Chinese Government and people have been following closely the developments in Somalia and deeply sympathize with the Somali people in their suffering.
 We urge all the Somali factions to cease all hostilities and fulfil their commitments to provide safety for the personnel of UNOSOM II during their withdrawal.
 We also sincerely hope that neighbouring States and regional organizations will continue to help the Somali people achieve an early national reconciliation, thus contributing to peace and stability in that region.
 The President: I thank the representative of China for his kind words addressed to me.
 Mr. Cdenas (Argentina) (interpretation from Spanish): First, on behalf of my delegation, I congratulate you, Madam, and welcome your accession to the presidency of the Security Council.
 My delegation also takes this opportunity to express its appreciation for the work done last month by the delegation of United Kingdom, led by Ambassador Hannay.
 Since then, to try to achieve a reasonable solution to the crisis in Somalia, the Council has adopted various measures in a variety of contexts.
 The resolution that we have just adopted reflects the fact that, because of the present climate of insecurity and the unsatisfactory progress in national reconciliation, UNOSOM II is effectively prevented from carrying out its mandate.
 The Special Representative of the Secretary-General will continue to work throughout the period of the mandate of UNOSOM II, and beyond, to try to help the Somali parties to achieve national reconciliation through peaceful dialogue.
 In this context, it is particularly important that there be strict observance and monitoring of the arms embargo imposed on Somalia by this Council.
 We trust that the international community will continue and strengthen its support for the Somali people and efforts to achieve genuine peace.
 But there is no doubt that the magnitude and viability of those activities will depend almost entirely on the degree of cooperation and security offered by the parties in Somalia.
 The phased withdrawal of UNOSOM II's military force must involve precautions to ensure that it takes place in an orderly and secure manner, minimizing the risks to personnel and equipment, to other personnel involved in relief operations and to the Somali people themselves.
 We also wish to remind the parties in Somalia of their heavy, direct responsibility for the protection and security of UNOSOM II personnel and equipment and of personnel participating in humanitarian activities to help the Somali people.
 We welcome the assurances of cooperation and non-interference with the withdrawal process offered by the Somali parties to those who participated in the mission that the Security Council sent to Somalia because of the important decision it was about to take on the future of UNOSOM II.
 My Government wishes once again to thank all those who have dedicated themselves to humanitarian and peace-keeping activities in Somalia. In particular, we remember all those who lost their lives in carrying out their duties.
 These are the first two essential steps along the road to peace, and we trust that they will be taken.
 However, we remind those factions that it is not enough to speak of peace; first one must believe in it.
 Although necessary, conviction is not sufficient.
 One must work for peace.
 The President: I thank the representative of Argentina for his kind words addressed to me.
 Sir David Hannay (United Kingdom): May I convey my congratulations to you, Madam President, on assuming the presidency, and my thanks to those of my colleagues who have spoken generously about the presidency during the month of October.
 It was of course an ambitious mission to begin with.
 Despite these obstacles, my Government believed that the combined efforts of the international community and the Somali people and their leaders would enable us to complete that mission by March 1995.
 Through the efforts of UNOSOM, the United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations, as well as the commitment of very many Somali communities and individuals, much progress was made.
 But, regrettably, there was no corresponding commitment on the part of the Somali faction leaders to achieve political reconciliation, or to cooperate in creating conditions of security.
 The continued absence of progress on political reconciliation and the lack of cooperation on security issues have left UNOSOM unable to achieve the objectives we set it, and it is against this background that we have taken a decision today to terminate the operation on 31 March l995.
 It is in many ways a tragedy that we have been forced to take this decision without having achieved the objectives of the United Nations, and while the future of Somalia remains so uncertain.
 But the situation on the ground really leaves us little option. We can no longer justify maintaining 15,000 troops in Somalia when they fulfil little function other than to protect themselves.
 The decision to terminate the Operation without clear fulfilment of its objective is all the more disappointing when we consider that many United Nations lives have been lost ln Somalia already.
 With the adoption of today's resolution, the message to the Somali parties is clear.
 A return to peace and the establishment of viable national institutions can be achieved only by Somalis themselves. We hope that they will make a sustained effort to work together to resolve the political impasse in Somalia.
 The responsibility for the future peace and prosperity of their country rests firmly in their hands.
 It is also clear that the decision we have taken today has implications not only for Somalia, but also for other countries of the region.
 We cannot deny the potential for regional instability if fighting breaks out once again in Somalia.
 But their ability to provide assistance, both humanitarian and rehabilitation or reconstruction assistance, will depend on the degree of cooperation and security offered by the Somali parties.
 My Government remains ready to provide assistance on this basis and will continue to support activities under way in north-west Somalia.
 UNOSOM's involvement in Somalia has been a sad story of noble aims subverted and undermined by a fundamental lack of cooperation from those the United Nations went to help.
 Of course mistakes have been made.
 The President: I thank the representative of the United Kingdom for the kind words he addressed to me.
 Mr. Sardenberg (Brazil): I wish to congratulate you very warmly, Madam President, on your assumption of the office of President of the Security Council.
 Your competence and leadership will contribute decisively to the conduct of our work during the month of November.
 In this process, the Security Council assessed the involvement of the United Nations in Somalia and discussed how best it could contribute by continuing to support Somalia and the Somali people in fostering national reconciliation and the formation of a broad-based Government of national unity.
 The mission in Somalia was a fundamental element in the international struggle to eradicate famine and contain a humanitarian catastrophe of wider proportions.
 More recently, UNOSOM II troops have played the important role of providing security for humanitarian organizations as they conduct their activities.
 Too much has been done and too many lives have been spent, with glaringly scarce results in the attempt to create an environment conducive to the attainment of a peace settlement and lasting political stability.
 Resolution 897 (1994) represented a watershed in the mandate of the United Nations Operation in Somalia.
 In moving towards that adjustment, the Council made it clear that the Somali parties and their leaders bear the ultimate responsibility for setting up viable national political institutions for their country.
 My delegation voted in favour of the resolution just adopted because it provides the necessary framework for the role of the personnel of UNOSOM II and for the continuation of a United Nations presence in Somalia.
 As we approach the termination of the United Nations Operation in Somalia, my delegation pays tribute to all those who, selflessly, have risked or lost their lives in the cause of peace in Somalia, and expresses its gratitude to the troop-contributing countries for their continued commitment to the Operation.
 The President: I thank the representative of Brazil for the kind words he addressed to me.
 Mr. Ya\x{9391}z-Barnuevo (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish): As this is my delegation's first statement this month, I wish to begin by congratulating you, Madam President, on the wise and rigorous manner in which you are conducting the Council's proceedings, thus displaying your experience and high diplomatic skills.
 You can count on our complete cooperation.
 By resolution 954 (1994), which the Security Council has just adopted unanimously, we have extended the mandate of the current United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II) for a final period until 31 March 1995.
 This was a difficult decision, which the Council took in a fully informed manner and with a full sense of responsibility.
 Led in exemplary fashion by the Permanent Representative of New Zealand, Ambassador Keating, the mission effectively fulfilled its mandate, as the oral report of 31 October to the members of the Council reflects.
 The lack of cooperation and the desire for political dominance, as manifested in struggles and divisions between the various clans, have contributed to the creation of a climate of insecurity, making it impossible to achieve the objectives of the United Nations in Somalia.
 Hence, there is no justification for the personnel of UNOSOM II to remain in the country beyond the established deadline.
